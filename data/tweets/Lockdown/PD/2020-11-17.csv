Neutral,@DeniseMcAllister,"COVID: a 0.06 percent death toll.  This is NOT a national emergency. The mandates, orders, masks, separations and lockdowns are abuses of power in response to a virus that is an extremely LOW death rate and toll on the country.  The response has one goal: government management of the US economy and control of the American people."
