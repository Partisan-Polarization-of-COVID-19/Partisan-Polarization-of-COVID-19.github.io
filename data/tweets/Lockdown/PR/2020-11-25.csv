A few days ago I got creative and did some graphic design work from home, then threw together a website and created some merchandise with my (first) design. I'm on a mission to make some income from home, while at the same time supporting Trump by raising money towards his fight to keep his rightful position as our President! So from now through 12/10/2020, I will be donating 10% from all purchases from my store to Trump's cause. So if you could PLEASE echo the hell out of this, that would be so amazing!

If they cared about voter fraud, they could print off a list of everyone who committed it And if they cared about lowering crime they would have already made the world a safer and better place.

Neutral,@DS17Storm,"Another record broken! President Trump does it again. The DOW broke 30,000 for the first time ever as the Trump economy roars back from the China virus shutdowns. Despite Democrat efforts to steal the 2020 election from President Trump, the markets keep on rolling along. Does this mean there must be sentiment in the markets that President Trump is going to serve another four more years?"
Neutral,@CarlGallups,"A WORD OF PERSPECTIVE PASTOR CARL SAYS: The media shutdowns, states certifying in the midst of a huge fraud allegation from the White House itself, have all worked to our advantage. Trump knew all of that. This now gives Trump standing in the courts - especially the SCOTUS. That's where all of this is headed. That's where Trump's legal team WANTED it to head. There's a constitutional process this course of events must follow. On top of that, Sidney Powell and Lin Woods (two of America's most powerful and peer-respected attorneys) are still pursuing their course of action with the full blessing of the White House and White House attorneys.  Be patient. AND PRAY!!!!! God gets the VERY FINAL word. Wait on HIM. Are backs are up to the Red Sea. Egypt's army appears to be on the verge of overwhelming us. Wait and see what the Lord will do....."

Neutral,@Ironside141,Boycott the big box stores black Friday sales. Lock downs are coming again. Small businesses will get screwed like before. The big retailers will profit off the lock downs.  Support small businesses and avoid the big retailers. Also the boycott will hit the state with a loss of tax revenue.

He doesn't seem rattled at all. One certainty if he wins as I think he will he will have everything he needs to take down the whole Democrat party at every level, the fake news media and obliterate the unconstitutional lock downs."
