Negative,@FreeEarthlings,"Dr. #ReinerFuellmich on #PCRtestScandal  The #Covid19Crisis must be renamed a #CoronaScandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages. How dangerous is the virus? What is the significance of a positive #PCRtest? What is the collateral damage with respect to #health and #economy? An international network of lawyers will argue the biggest #TortCase ever - the #CoronaFraudScandal - which has unfolded into probably the greatest #CrimesAgainstHumanity ever committed. #Scientists and #lawyers recognise that as a result of the deliberate panic-mongering and the corona measures enabled by this panic, #democracy is in great danger of being replaced by #FascistTotalitarian models. To make sure that no one will ever again be in a position of such power as to be able to defraud humanity, or to attempt to manipulate us with their corrupt agendas. #SaveTheEconomy #DefendHumanity #EndLockdowns  #MakeLawLawfulAgain  #GetOffOurRights"
Negative,@Jimbo510,COVID 19 HAS SAVED LIVES  I Said this 6 months ago...  The normal daily death rate in ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ before #covid19hoax was 7700 Deaths 7700x30days x 7 months = 1.6 million normal deaths before #covidhoax Since we know they (Deep State) have been counting all deaths Covid deaths  Why are people freaking out about 200K deaths?  Why are we still on Lockdown? #ReOpenAmerica #DrainTheSwamp #Kaga2020 @AmericanQTpie @Chiefsson @Cobrarick98 @US13s @EndHumanTrafficking2020 @Name Hidden @Cherokeeowl @Gipperguy @Puppetics2018 @HealSuffering @IsaacQAnon @usrbo @Pinkk9lover @lucki @Sezz @Leangelmuse @tfurlipa @CarolYoung2795 @theconservativetsunami   @harlangarrett  @dobelover45  @b00m3rs00n3r1  @cosmicwildchild  @usaingodwetrust  @motay  @leannedini  @mamabear44  @swgarealtor  @neutronstar  @chaysbrain  @hipchristianchick  @qbabyaus  @lukaszsuprun  @marcpowerland  @clintsprague  @christianne  @seanbos  @soulofapatriot  @daniellewv
Neutral,@hairgoddess1,"For those who want to wear a mask, by all means do so. For those who don't want to wear a mask. That's your choice. Stop shaming each other. We all have a free will and choice. Unfortunately, I have to wear one sometimes because the state and city I live in are being douchebags about it. They're sending board of cosmetology inspectors out to check on us. After being in quarantine for over a month and not qualifying for a forgivable ppp loan, I'm forced into an unforgiving situation. I stand with all my fellow Patriots in believing the swamp wants to control us."

Neutral,@Gebhardjb9,"The virus is raging in Europe right now. I heard they are going to go with the dumb fuck lock downs again... smfh. That's right, destroy yourselves over a virus that's 99%+ survivable. What the fuck is wrong with these stupid mother fuckers and why the fuck are people going along with it? Europe is heading for disaster, and if biden gets in we will be headed down the same dumb fuck path. The stupidity is getting out of control fear is clouding people's minds. It's the media that is the enemy not the virus. Just my thoughts."
