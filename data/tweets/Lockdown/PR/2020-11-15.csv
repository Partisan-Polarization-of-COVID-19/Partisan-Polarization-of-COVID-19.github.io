Positive,@dryan7,Pelosi to Host Large Dinner for New House Members as Democrats Urge Americans To Stay Home and Not Host Family Gatherings Due to Coronavirus
Positive,@Jeanna929017376560,As a COVID survivor I really have mixed emotions on this. I wear a mask to protect myself because I don’t ever want to be that sick again. I can’t stay home. I have to work and buy groceries. So I have to be out and about. I honestly don’t know what the answer is on all of this.
Positive,@BeliveInAmerica,"We cannot let these animals run the streets of America. When we have a rally we need to show up like they do. Conservatives showing up for a peaceful demonstration, must be prepared to defend each other or don’t have a rally, stay home and take your medicine. We cannot stand for a single fellow demonstrator being attacked by the gang of cowards and basement dwellers, the exact reason Lunch Bucket Joe identifies with them. We are Americans, that used to mean something to all of us."
Positive,@Candice23,I think people should only vote if they have a job or cannot have a job (due to disability or other circumstances). Of course being a stay at home mom or dad counts as a job! You all know what I mean by government handouts and people that just don’t do anything and still get money off the government.
Positive,@191powm,"President-elect Joe Biden has floated a nationwide lockdown and mask mandate in response to surging coronavirus cases across the country. But even if he follows through and orders all Americans to stay at home and cover their faces when in public, don’t expect to see those mandates enforced in South Dakota. The office of Gov. Kristi Noem said in a statement to the Argus Leader Friday that the first-term governor, who’s risen to stardom in the Republican party for her hands-off approach to managing the pandemic, has no intention of using state resources to enforce any federal COVID-19 orders."
Neutral,@AbbyJohnsonOfficial,"It’s time for every church in America to defy lockdown, quarantine and any other orders related to this virus. People need to be in Church. They need to fellowship with other believers. They NEED hope. They need Jesus. Stop cowering to the government. Stand up and fight."

Neutral,@Army79,"In June Fort Benning did everything necessary to prevent COVID-19 spread. They quarantined recruits 14 days, tested and retested after 14 days. Wore masks even while sleeping. Still recruits were infected after another test a week or 2 later. So this study is no surprise."
Neutral,@Bonita,"Marches or Car rallies are being held all over California. If we leave California, Gov Newsom says we have to self quarantine. But we have people living in Mexico who cross every day into San Diego because that’s where they work. 22% of new cases in the county were spread by those is what county officials said. We are on the most restrictive tier now for at least 3 weeks."
Neutral,@JimJordan,-Lockdowns -Mask police -Curfews  What about freedom?
Neutral,@John0079,"Lockdowns didn't stop the virus, but they did ruin the lives of millions of people."
Neutral,@DiamondAndSilk,Governors do not have the right to take away freedoms by choosing lockdowns for Americans instead of allowing Americans to make their own choice with therapeutic medicines or a vaccine!

Neutral,@AJCats,"NYers aren’t stupid, Democrats can’t do this to people! Trash, crime, taxes, lockdowns... Enough is enough. No idle threats here- people are either leaving or voting Republican. We saw a HUGE red wave in NYC this election cycle."
Neutral,@Amok2020,All of the fake #COVID crockery is just a test run of the system the deranged #Liberal #Democrats want to use to implement revolutionary #communism in the United States of America. We have to stop them!

Neutral,@Emfall,"Biden advisers differ on national coronavirus lockdown, as one calls it 'measure of last resort' | Fox News I never thought I would call this fake news, but he is not our president elect. All the votes have not been voted and the election was rigged"
