Negative,@Audax1954,"The coronavirus is back in force. Many nations around the world are seeing alarming rises in cases and deaths, totals that in many instances exceed the highs reached in March, April, and May. From the beginning of the pandemic, governments around the world have tried to tame the virus. All have failed, to varying degrees. Whether governments implement draconian lockdowns, modest lockdowns, or no lockdowns at all, the virus has spread. Some countries with harsh lockdowns have fared better; many have fared worse. As some have pointed out, the virus doesnâ€™t seem to care what policies you put in place."
Neutral,@andweknow,10.2.20: TEN days of DARKNESS/Quarantine? RED OCTOBER! Watch here:
Neutral,@buskirk,Here is Fauci confirming that transmission of respiratory viruses by asymptomatic viruses is very rare and is NEVER the driver of outbreaks. So why are public health authorities issuing guidance to treat asymptomatic people as if they are major vectors of viral transmission? That is one of the premises of lockdowns and quarantines.
Neutral,@CarolLyne,"MPs need to be reminded of their legal duty or they will be held to account and could be charged with Malfeasance (wrongdoing or misconduct especially by a public official) resulting in a 10 year prison sentence. Unbalanced Valence, Half-whit Whitty, Bully-boy Boris, Hand on Cock-sorry- Mr Hancock should be arrested for causing more deaths due to the unlawful lockdowns. #plandemic #parler #politics"
Neutral,@11phenomenon,Weird how states big into lockdowns have done nothing about homeless packed into shelters like sardines coming and going infecting others. Everyday a super spreader while others are ironically moved closer to homelessness due to job killing restrictions. And yet the masses are forced to wear unhealthy masks while the homeless super spreader problem and demonstrations/riot super spreaders are ignored.
