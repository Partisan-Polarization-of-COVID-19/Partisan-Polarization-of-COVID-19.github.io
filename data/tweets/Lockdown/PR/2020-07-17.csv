Neutral,@DeepStuff,"The power of the mainstream media has grown out of control, and this cannot be allowed to continue. Their reach is enormous and instant. With their ability feign outrage and tragedy where none should exists, is very dangerous. Just look at what is happening now with the Black Lives Matter movement, defund the police and even the COVID-19 shutdowns. They literally have politicians, celebrities, pro sports teams and businesses all cowering at their feet. This cannot fall into the realm of freedom of the press or free speech. They are now working in conjunction with policy makers to fix outcomes. We are now facing an existential crisis which should be obvious to all, but it isn’t and we have no way to communicate it to the masses. Thank God for #Parler, but is it enough? Please, let’s get the conversation started and keep it going! #Donaldtrump #foxnews #Seanhannity #tuckercarlson #oan #infowars #twexit #backtheblue #defendpolice #police #patriots #wakeup"
