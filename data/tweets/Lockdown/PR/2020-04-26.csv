Negative,@conservativecountrymedia,Is this possible? Can we do this? Has the government destroyed small business? #reopenamerica
Positive,@DessoffAltodoc,"I’m amused by those without any scientific background dismissing concepts like herd immunity. Risk is a part of life. Balancing risk is something we all used to be comfortable with. It seems some are happy relinquishing liberty and freedom for the idea that never leaving the house means no one will die. It’s far more complicated than that. Following logical guidance to stay at home makes sense in many situations but not in others. Unless herd immunity is built we will be in perpetual lockdown. I’m following the rules and enjoy exercise in the fresh air. If you can’t get out even for exercise make sure you’re getting vitamin D. Stay healthy, consider personal and communal risk and strive for Liberty."
