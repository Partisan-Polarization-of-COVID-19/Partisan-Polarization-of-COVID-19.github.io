Positive,@jamesctheman,These politicians really want to defund the police? The cops should call their bluff and stay home for a day. The 99% of good cops who patrol our streets everyday don't deserve to be treated like this.
Neutral,@chrisglenne,"It's infuriating, if we had known that the cure for COVID19 was mindless virtue signalling, we could have all just gone out and yelled and waved some signs around. All these stupid lockdowns and social distancing nonsense could have been avoided."
Neutral,@Clinton614,"This is what armed Trump supporters 'protesting unlawful lockdowns' looked like a couple of weeks ago.  They didn't loot, riot, damage or steal anything, and they were called 'Domestic Terrorists' by the mainstream media!"
