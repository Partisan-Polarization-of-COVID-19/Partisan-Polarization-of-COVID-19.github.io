Positive,@Castaneda0418,"@GovRonDeSantis  REOPEN PALM BEACH COUNTY SCHOOLS. Enough!!  @DanBongino  I think you would agree, no? Parents can‚Äôt afford to stay home. We have jobs."
Positive,@HubLife,"Don't want to die of Corona Virus? It's simple. If you aren't obese, aren't over the age of 80 and don't have any pre-existing immune problems, you'll be fine. If you ARE part of the groups above, social distance, stay home and or use a mask. The rest of you stop being pussys"
Positive,@4651lainey,"The first tests CDC released were tainted as were they all over the world, UK even sued China over test that were tainted with the virus. All you people testing should rethink being tested.  I will not wear a mask I will not test  I will not vaccinate  I will not stay home  I will vote #Trump2020"
Neutral,@AmericanSupremacist,"The same party that opposed the China travel ban, depleted the federal medical stockpile after H1N1 and refused to restock it, put infected people in nursing homes, blocked hydroxychlorquine, told people Trump wanted them to drink Lysol, that brought infected Americans into the general public in violation of quarantine procedures, is now claiming the death count would be lower if they were in charge. Seriously they‚Äôre claiming that"

Neutral,@Dogwithabone,All the BLM protests was always going to cause case rises but they were all proud to say the risk of Corona was worth it to protest what they believed in. Will they be saying that if their loved ones get ill?  #alllivesmatter #antifabullshit #Boris  : Bradford and London boroughs among 36 'at-risk' areas that could be 'just days away' from local lockdowns
Neutral,@DAM1OAK,"Are you tired of social distancing? Tired of the lockdowns? Do you find yourself wishing things would just go back to normal like they were in 2019 when we were all just regular debt slaves to the central banks? Well then you just might be a psychopath. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§£ No, this is NOT satire. üßê According to a new peer reviewed study published on May 31st, people who ignore the new normal protocols display certain antagonistic personality traits. It appears we are fast approaching a time when opposing the establishment and questioning the government will be considered a mental disorder. They are ""projecting"" on the masses what they themselves are. I think we all know who the true psychopaths are. üíØ -Spiro Skouras"
Neutral,@Drillbuster,Islamic Eid is the cause of Melbourne‚Äôs second lock down. Muslims spread COVID-19
Neutral,@Birdsofafeather,With the protestors and rioters proving the myth of lock down the left are still trying to push mail inviting!?
Neutral,@DewsNewz,"Why we don‚Äôt trust anything coming from the mouths of Fauci, CDC or the NIH criminals..... They have yet to tell their citizens that zinc when used with quercetin (opens the cells up like hydroxychloroquine) is a great cheap preventative and will lesson symptoms of COVID-19 and using Budesonide and other anti inflammatories when diagnosed will ensure rapid recovery most of the time. Instead they mandate mask use, lock downs, expensive high end drugs, ventilators while putting COVID patients into nursing homes, and promoting useless vaccines (which we‚Äôve already paid for). They act this stupid and reckless and the MSM blames it on Trump.  What do you think they will do to you if he loses?  Trump 2020 4 More Years of Leftist butthurt!"
