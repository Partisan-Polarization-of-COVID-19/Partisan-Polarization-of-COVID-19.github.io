Neutral,@ChuckIFinley,"Brilliant ad here by the Justice Democratâ€™s, insane woman complaining about lockdowns costing her her job, begs you to vote for the guy who wants lockdowns, even if you donâ€™t like him. ðŸ™„"
Neutral,@11phenomenon,Weird how states big into lockdowns have done nothing about homeless packed into shelters like sardines coming and going infecting others. Everyday a super spreader while others are ironically moved closer to homelessness due to job killing restrictions. And yet the masses are forced to wear unhealthy masks while the homeless super spreader problem and demonstrations/riot super spreaders are ignored.
