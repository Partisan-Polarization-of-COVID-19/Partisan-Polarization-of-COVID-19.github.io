Positive,@BalloonGuyz,"Ok there's two slogans out there. One . Stay Loud! Stay Proud! Persist! and Resist!  The second is. Stay Home. Stay Calm . Stay Active. The first one is for B. L. M. L. G. B. T. And A.N.T.I.F.A. This means get up get out and be as loud and cause as much un-rest as we can, till we get what we demand!  The second is the Silent working majority. Stay Home , Shut Up, and DO AS WE SAY. I'm so glad I don't have children or grand children, to have to conform to the leftists point of view . Some day you will look at your children and or grand children and explain the reason they are not Free like you used to be. And your answer should be the truth. We the people let the Democratic party take over our country because we wouldn't GET UP GET OUT AND TAKE ON THIS OVER TAKE OF OUR COUNTRY! I'm so sorry you have to suffer like this ðŸ’” because of my/ our lack of STANDING UP LIKE GODS PEOPLE ARE TOLD TO DO! now we have lost our freedom and our country. Think about that ."

No mail in voting, if you can't have in person voting then delay it till you can. Loser's will never win unless they cheat."
