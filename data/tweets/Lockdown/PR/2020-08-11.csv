Neutral,@Americansforpeace,"The awakening is here, the recent shutdowns, government sponsored interruption of small business,and the curtailing of our civil liberties. When i run i fully intend on getting the D.C. mob out of our back yard. 1) As many of you know, I walked away from the D party in Feb. This decision came after watching that same party avocate for a socialistic society. I witnessed my family in Venezuela experience these same rights stripped from them. I have been warning Americans since the day I walked away, that we were headed down this same road. This is why I decided to run for U.S. Congress in TX CD8 2022. I refuse to sit on the sidelines and watch the D party destroy our cities. I promise to do everything in my power to protect the American people and our inalienable rights granted to us by the Constitution of the United States of America! WAPC🇺🇸✌️🏳️‍🌈"
