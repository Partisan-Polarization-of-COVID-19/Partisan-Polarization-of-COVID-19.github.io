Neutral,@CallumAntliff,"It is a great upset, to see Trump President and First Lady Melania Trump test positive for COVID-19. I wish them a speedy recovery, Iâ€™m sure theyâ€™ll look after each other as they get though quarantine and this difficult time! However, looking through social media and seeing death wishes and threats is despicable. You may not like the man, or donâ€™t agree with everything they say but at the end of the day theyâ€™re still human and important people in the world. Just like when Boris Johnson had the virus, they wished death on him even in his hospital bed.  Threats are coming from the other end of politics, left wing supporters and voters. At least be the better people and not stoop so low.
