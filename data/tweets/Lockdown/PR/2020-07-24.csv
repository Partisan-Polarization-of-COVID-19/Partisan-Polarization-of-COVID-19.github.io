Negative,@JimJordan,"Things the Democrats want: -Open borders & closed churches -Open borders & closed schools -Open borders & closed businesses -Open borders & closed gun shops -Open borders & closed stadiums How about instead of reopening the border, we reopen America?"
Positive,@DTrump2020,This is the last election you may actually have a choice if Republicans do not gain a huge win you can kiss your freedoms goodbye. Do not stay home. Go and vote.
Positive,@Antipolean,"What has #feminism given #women ? ☑️ Too #poor to have large #families. ☑️ When we DO have #children, we're too poor to stay at home, so we now entrust them to the state via #childcare, #kindergartens, #stateruneducation.  ☑️ House prices have skyrocketed in many countries. Thanks to #twoincomes being the norm, housing is now #lessaffordable than ever. ☑️ Most of us #work full time, often for low wages. No time for partners, children, friends, #community, #volunteering, personal hobbies. We're legions of #exhaustedwomen.  ☑️ We don't have the time or energy to cook, so we're fatter and sicker than our grandmothers were, with a shorter #lifeexpectancy than our mothers generation. #fatandsick  ☑️ We've been duped into believing that #hookupculture will make us happy, when the truth is that women derive real #happiness from deep, long-term, secure relationships with men.  #Feminism has failed women. It's time to throw it away.  #feminismiscancer #feminismsucks #antifeminism"
Neutral,@DukeHedaya,Of course she does. I wonder how many Americans she plans on taking care of financially. Not like lockdowns affect her.  F*ck This': Alyssa Milano Demands 'National Shut Down Now'
Neutral,@BethVanDuyne,Being in lockdowns take a physical and mental toll on people and families. I know I have to get out a walk when I can and it truly helps. Let me know what you do and maybe I can join you and your family on a walk sometime!
Neutral,@Jmraikes,"I am totally aware of the fear people have regarding this Covid but I am in awe of what these democrat governors have done. Being from Washington State the lockdowns were tolerable but presently I am in Albuquerque, NM and Draconian is very understated. The people are in a total panic, face masks, store closures and social distancing is extreme and people do not understand that this is a nasty China Flu designed to attack the elderly and underlying conditions population. 20 and 30 year olds are just getting sick, not overwhelming the system.  The population is totally poorly informed on the disease, riots, protests and all the hate being spewed by the minority Marxists and Hard Left. To all of us continue to speak the truth, educate with facts, and turn at least one person a day to understand what Conservatism and Humanity is all about."
