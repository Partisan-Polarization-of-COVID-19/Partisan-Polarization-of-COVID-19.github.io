Positive,@Gregmo49,Sick and tired of mayors ordering people have to stay home and then do what ever they want. When they are caught all they have say ‚ÄúI am sorry‚Äù and we are to forget about their evil deed. From now on they should be arrested placed in jail removed from office and a heavy monetary find.

Neutral,@BellumSheepdog,"Covid 99.9% survival rate. Yet it is used to strike terror in (a legion of) wimpy hearts. If Biden, it will be quarantine nation.  If Biden, it must be Civil War.  Lord, wake them up before it is too late!"
Neutral,@DIPYO,"Double Standards MUCH? ü§¨ California Exempts Hollywood Movie Studios From COVID Lockdowns, Restrictions"
Neutral,@Bobalee,Now some on the left are beating up on Cubans in Miami for listening to Trump telling them about the left‚Äôs socialistic leanings. Cuban brothers know what socialist smell like better than any of us. Socialists live off of other people‚Äôs hard earned money and suck the blood out of hardworking people and their nations economy until they are a Skeleton of their former self. Then socialist leaders imprison anybody that looks at them the wrong way or sometimes these citizens just disappear.  You think not. Just look at what the dem governors are doing with the coronavirus lockdowns while at the same time they break their own rules. And they have some limits on their power.
