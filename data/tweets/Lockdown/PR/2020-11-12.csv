Positive,@DiannaLara,"Before COVID, if I had complained to a mental health professional that I was upset with my family or friends because they refused to wear a mask around me during flu season, I probably would have been told that I was being co-dependent and should take responsibility for my own fear, do what I feel is appropriate for me to stay healthy (like stay home), and not expect others to change their behavior just so I can feel safe. But not in 2020. We’re raising up a generation of malignant co-dependents who not only want to make others responsible to make them feel safe, but advocate for punishing anyone who won’t fall in line."

Positive,@Annaq2020,"Honestly I became a lot more anti-vax lately, just because we are told to vaccinate ourselves against a totally overblown and slightly more dangerous cold/flu virus. It seems as if the coronavirus is more so a Chinese bioweapon designed to intimidate the West into imposing costly lockdowns. China planned for us to get scared of this virus, overreact, and commit economic suicide. Once our economy is ruined, then China can just take over and rule the world. Thankfully, we have Trump as President. He is patriotic enough to understand that national lockdowns would be disastrous. Thank God we have Trump leading us through this totally overblown pandemic so well. #scamdemic #chinavirus"

Neutral,@GringoViejo,"Peter Helmes’ opening piece in this long PDF details—from the words of Chinese defectors—how something called G614 has emerged from China’s labs over the summer. This virus seems to render SARS-CoV-2 more infectious without enhancing its lethality (and Li-Meng Yan insists that many more such “boosters” are in the works). The objective? To fuel further panic, justify further lockdowns, and secure the grip on power of the Davos/Club of Rome crowd. And this, brothers and sisters, is the planetary *carcinero* in whose hip pocket our bought-and-paid-for “president elect” firmly sits! What I’ve described above is an act of war against the world. At the moment, looks like our former USA will join China on one side against humanity on the other. #sars-cov2 #g614 #bidenandchina #chinaswaronworld"

Neutral,@CraigTheTechTeacher,"""Under the best circumstances, 50% of all small businesses fail in their first five years. Over 100,000 businesses are estimate to have closed for good due to economic shutdowns. Restaurants are the hardest hit among the over 22 million jobs lost from the shutdowns. Many restaurants are small business owned and managed. Let's also not forget, many small business owners operate on thin margins and can only ""float"" paychecks, overhead, invoices, receivables, and losses for 60 to 90 days.

I think we are still allowed to have them at least for a little while longer.

Neutral,@HeadBunWarmer,"There are multiple layers to the battles that we are facing. On one level, there is the election and the battle to find, expose, and resolve the epidemic of fraud.  On another level there is a battle against the totalitarian globalists that are, through their governmental ambassadors, attempting to lock down nations, force a mandatory vaccination, and dissolve our constitutionally protected freedoms.  On another level still, we are battling the Central banking cartel as they are using both the presidential election and the pandemic to force us into a global digital currency.
