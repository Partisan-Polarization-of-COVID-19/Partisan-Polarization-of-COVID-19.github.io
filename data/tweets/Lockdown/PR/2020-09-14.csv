Neutral,@Heiwanoinori,There you have it. Lockdowns at this point are all political
Neutral,@Dbaco007,"Everything Mayor London Breed says in this article points back to Pelosi's failures. What has she does for her city? Just look at the streets ridden with human urine, feces, drug needles, and filth. Focused on issues at hand? “WHERE'S NANCY?” She's holding up legislation that would help ease the financial burden placed on people with their endless, rediculous, shutdowns and mandates until she gets her own way. Her career of “Working for this country” has been a dismal failure. It's high time for this miserable hack of a misleader to retire, go home, and get fat eating her ice cream."
