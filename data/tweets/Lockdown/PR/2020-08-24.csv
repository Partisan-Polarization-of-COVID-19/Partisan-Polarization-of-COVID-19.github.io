Positive,@FaithFamilyFitness,"It’s simple to me. If you’re afraid to teach in the classroom, then stay at home. Plenty of qualified teachers willing to do the job. Substitute and student teachers are better than kids trying to figure it out on their own at home. Not to mention all the intangibles: Socialization, counseling services, meals at school, etc."
Neutral,@Angiez00r,So last Friday I was having Shortness of breath and other symptoms. I immediately quarantined myself from my family. Took a COVID-19 test Saturday and tomorrow the quarantine period is over and still no test results. I asked for a steroid inhaler and that wouldn't have been given to me if I hadn't asked. What a poor system. If they would allow Hydroxychloroquine we wouldn't be in the current situation of high cases. I believe the front line doctors. I go back to work Monday without test results since the labs are overwhelmed.
Neutral,@FaithFamilyFitness,"We have a primary coming up in Michigan tomorrow. After months of lockdowns, business closings and mandatory face masks for all indoor gatherings, the governor has declared that face masks aren’t required to vote. Where is the logic in that, or in any of her other decisions for that matter?"
