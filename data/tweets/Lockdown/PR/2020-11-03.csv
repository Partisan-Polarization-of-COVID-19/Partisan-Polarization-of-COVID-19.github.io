Positive,@carpedonktum,"No matter what happens on Tuesday, I want to thank President Trump and all of you for providing me with all of the amazing opportunities and experiences over the last 4 years. I never could have dreamed that a stay at home dad from Kansas, making videos in his spare time could be so blessed as I have. From being invited to the White House, to traveling around the country, and being elevated to a position where I could reach 273,000 people on Twitter, 231,000 people on Parler, 54,000 people on youtube, 51,000 people on Facebook, and 38,000 people on Instagram. Thank you and I love you all. I am the luckiest guy in history."
