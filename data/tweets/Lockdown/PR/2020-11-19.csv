Positive,@Jennywestin,"You know how we spread the Flu around every year? Everyone you know gets the Flu and it has to run its course through the 'Flu Season'. We continue through our regular lives and stay home only when too ill to go to work, but usually by then you have already exposed a bunch of people. Did you stop to think that maybe someone, who you infected, died from complications due to the Flu? Are you now going to hold the responsibility for their death? You knew someone could die from the Flu and you didn't protect them...how many people have you now killed over your lifetime? There's no end game to the scenario as a Virus is going to be deadly to someone. How long are you willing to wear a mask for? The rest of your life? For which Viruses?"
Positive,@brathman48,Ok I am pry going to open a bag of worms but I am always for our teachers of our kids and grandkids but when they want school to be closed due to this pandemic because they are so stressed makes my blood boil. Ok so they want to stay home and maybe zoom their kids what once a week? Or a short time a day. Well then they should only get paid for that short time the parents should get the rest of their pay!!! And talk about stressed what about the kids that love school and want to learn from the teacher they love. What about them dear teachers (not all of you I know many that want to be with their kids) but those that want paid but not really work. Also remember this they get paid for their summers off and would be ok if when school is on they worked. Sooo many in service I suppose necessary although when I was a kid I learned and teachers didn’t do these!!! Wake up teacher use your masks wash hands and tech our kids period.

Positive,@Jmath9367,IF and I sad IF Biden becomes president he already has no clue what he can and can’t do. He says he will implement a national lockdown due to covid-19. He will not have the power to do that. Shows how stupid he really is! Closing down again is not the answer. There are still people who now do not have jobs because of the first shutdown. People should have the freedom to work or run their business. If you are so afraid of covid you can quit your job or not patronize a business and stay scared in your home like Biden did.
Positive,@Gatorchick92,"So my oldest child's school is possibly closing. I'm pissed. While I'm currently a stay at home mother, having her in school helps out big time. Financially, etc. If they're going to be sending kids home and bs over this Rona bull, then we need to get paid! Teachers aren't doing that much when they're at home. Sorry not sorry. I also have a 2 year old who I'm constantly having to tend to as well. I can already see it, better grab myself a 24 pack of Michelob ultra this weekend for myself so once the kids are in bed, I can have what tiny bit of me time I'll get lmao. Which I don't mind but...closing schools isn't going to f'in work. My god. We been down this damn road already."

More an more discussions regarding the possibility of another lockdown have been popping up everywhere...Take a look at what's going on in Chicago, it's starting. I hope people are realizing that no matter who gets in office, the results are the same! It's coming folks, prepare now and get things in order as best you can.  What I think might happen is that we may not see an official announcement of it declared, so as to not cause too much panic, but just a steady continuous flow of restrictions and limitations/curfews etc pouring in, state by state. Until you stop and look around and see that darn... This is the second nationwide lockdown after all."

As we hear about more and more lockdowns pushed by people who have no concerns for small businesses, there is something small businesses can do. If you are a small business owner then let people know your store is a ""mask free zone"" or ""mask optional zone"". Do not shutter your doors. Do not make your staff wear masks. Welcome the community in. If you have to, disobey local ordinances and put up signs stating your business is staying open as a ""peaceful protest"" against the lockdowns.  If we resist in a peaceful manner, but remain steadfast we can beat this maniacal governors and wanna-be dictators.  Why should you be put out of business so somebody, somewhere with no relationship to you may or may not live if they happen to catch COVID; after all they have a 99.95% chance of surviving COVID whereas you have a 99.95% chance of having your business killed by shutting down."

The Democrat governor’s pay is going up by $25,000, bumping his salary from $225,000 to $250,000 all during a financial crisis in the state due to the coronavirus pandemic. Just one month ago, Cuomo outlined the dire situation New York was seeing itself in due to reduced revenue amid numerous shutdowns in the state. “New York state is already $50 billion in debt between state and local governments and they have not passed legislation on the state and local relief,” Gov. Cuomo stated. “If the state has a deficit and the local governments have a deficit, we can’t fund essential workers.”"
