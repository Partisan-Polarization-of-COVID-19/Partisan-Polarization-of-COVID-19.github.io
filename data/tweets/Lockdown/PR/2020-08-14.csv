Negative,@JimJordan,"Things the Democrats want: -Open borders & closed churches -Open borders & closed schools -Open borders & closed businesses -Open borders & closed gun shops -Open borders & closed stadiums How about instead of reopening the border, we reopen America?"
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"An apartment complex in Ventura County, CA is locking their residents inside the building until all of them are tested for Covid. I called the number, was put on hold, & then eventually forwarded to voicemail. This is the dangerous slope we’ve been talking about - & it’s exactly what the Cabal wants. They don’t even have to mandate laws or draft legislation when landlords, banks, businesses, etc. will go along with the agenda & require this out of their tenants /customers. And what happens if 1 child tests positive in a public school setting? Will they lockdown that entire school until every kid is forcefully tested then shipped to a “quarantine facility” if positive? This is called tyranny & it never ends up well for us citizens. It’s time to wake up & fight for our God-given rights. #WWG1WGA"

Neutral,@7SDG,"This is important. We didn’t need the lockdowns . We didn’t need the turmoil, lost jobs, or other emerging health issues. We had the solution all along. Fauci and the media did a number on this country."
