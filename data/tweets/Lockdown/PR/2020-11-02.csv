Negative,@FreeEarthlings,"Dr. #ReinerFuellmich on #PCRtestScandal  The #Covid19Crisis must be renamed a #CoronaScandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages. How dangerous is the virus? What is the significance of a positive #PCRtest? What is the collateral damage with respect to #health and #economy? An international network of lawyers will argue the biggest #TortCase ever - the #CoronaFraudScandal - which has unfolded into probably the greatest #CrimesAgainstHumanity ever committed. #Scientists and #lawyers recognise that as a result of the deliberate panic-mongering and the corona measures enabled by this panic, #democracy is in great danger of being replaced by #FascistTotalitarian models. To make sure that no one will ever again be in a position of such power as to be able to defraud humanity, or to attempt to manipulate us with their corrupt agendas. #SaveTheEconomy #DefendHumanity #EndLockdowns  #MakeLawLawfulAgain  #GetOffOurRights"
Negative,@JimJordan,Democrats: ‚ÄúNo Thanksgiving this year.‚Äù President Trump: ‚ÄúNo more lockdowns.‚Äù
Negative,@Jimbo510,COVID 19 HAS SAVED LIVES  I Said this 6 months ago...  The normal daily death rate in üá∫üá∏ before #covid19hoax was 7700 Deaths 7700x30days x 7 months = 1.6 million normal deaths before #covidhoax Since we know they (Deep State) have been counting all deaths Covid deaths  Why are people freaking out about 200K deaths?  Why are we still on Lockdown? #ReOpenAmerica #DrainTheSwamp #Kaga2020 @AmericanQTpie @Chiefsson @Cobrarick98 @US13s @EndHumanTrafficking2020 @Name Hidden @Cherokeeowl @Gipperguy @Puppetics2018 @HealSuffering @IsaacQAnon @usrbo @Pinkk9lover @lucki @Sezz @Leangelmuse @tfurlipa @CarolYoung2795 @theconservativetsunami   @harlangarrett  @dobelover45  @b00m3rs00n3r1  @cosmicwildchild  @usaingodwetrust  @motay  @leannedini  @mamabear44  @swgarealtor  @neutronstar  @chaysbrain  @hipchristianchick  @qbabyaus  @lukaszsuprun  @marcpowerland  @clintsprague  @christianne  @seanbos  @soulofapatriot  @daniellewv
Positive,@BrianHarker,"I know we are supposed to take the high road, but should we loot and burn the BLM and Antifa busses every time they roll into town to cause problems? Leave stranded everywhere they go and maybe they'll stay home."
Positive,@IAintBlack,"If you're worried about spreading the Chinese Virus to your loved ones, go get tested, if you're positive stay home or take the proper precautions, if your negative go spend time with your family, free from restrictions. Testing is free."
Positive,@buskirk,"The Biden-Harris Team is already talking about 4-6 weeks of new national lockdowns if they take office.  Remember when it was 2 weeks to slow the spread?  Remember when if you just wore a mask, we wouldn't have to lockdown? (We've had mask mandates for months) Remember when we just needed better treatments and a vaccine? (Regeneron is widely available & multiples vaccines will be available before inauguration day. China has a widely distributed vaccine already) But still...they want to lock you in your house, stop your life, keep you away from church and your loved ones.  No."
Positive,@conservativewarrior,GOD BLESSS TATE REEVES!  Mississippi Gov.: State Won't Participate in National Lockdown
Neutral,@buskirk,Here is Fauci confirming that transmission of respiratory viruses by asymptomatic viruses is very rare and is NEVER the driver of outbreaks. So why are public health authorities issuing guidance to treat asymptomatic people as if they are major vectors of viral transmission? That is one of the premises of lockdowns and quarantines.
Neutral,@DiamondAndSilk,Wonder if the reason these Governors are pushing lockdowns could be to stop the courts from operating? Something to think about....
Neutral,@JimJordan,Don‚Äôt cancel Thanksgiving.  Don‚Äôt cancel Christmas.  Cancel lockdowns.
Neutral,@DiamondAndSilk,"There is no need for more lockdowns. This is just a way for ignorant Governors to tank our economy, flatten people's lives and kill their livelihoods!"
Neutral,@Apocalypse911,Dems are going to try to keep the lockdowns going through the January Runoffs. Need to keep the mail in ballot scam alive.
Neutral,@DiamondAndSilk,Governors do not have the right to take away freedoms by choosing lockdowns for Americans instead of allowing Americans to make their own choice with therapeutic medicines or a vaccine!
Neutral,@DiamondAndSilk,"The left wing media, including Fox will never get us to believe that 77 million people voted to have more lockdowns and their livelihoods flattened!"
Neutral,@Bigshow,That California governor is full of shit. He wants lockdowns to kill the economy in California because deep state told him to shut down. That Governor doesn‚Äôt care about anyone in California.
Neutral,@GaryFos22481,So everyone about all of these lockdowns. There is a prison here is Alaska it has almost 1500 inmates in it. Since around April every inmate and staff had orders to wear masks 100% of the time. Last night on the news it was released that they had over 400 cases of Covid and have had two deaths. So if masks worked how did 400 chat catch the virus.
Neutral,@E4foundation,"Hello friends on Parler! As most of you know, due to COVID (and the associated lockdowns and nonsense that have gone along with it), things like singing and choruses have almost entirely been eliminated. From one moment to the next, choirs and choruses across the country have been forced to stop singing together as potential ‚Äúsuper spreaders‚Äù. Despite all of this, we are NOT disheartened and are finding new ways to stay connected and sing. So this Christmas, please consider sending a virtual choir Christmas card to your family and friends at the below link. Not only is it a great way to tell your family that you are thinking of them this Christmas but it will help support my chorus and help it stay alive until we can all get back together again in harmony. In addition, you‚Äôll be supporting a 501-C3 organization and it is fully tax deductible! Win Win all the way around! Thank you all for checking it out and Merry Christmas!"
Neutral,@brodheads,Dr. Scott Atlas demolishes Joe Biden's COVID lockdown claim
Neutral,@BreitbartsBest,"A Los Angeles bar owner was fighting back tears Friday, claiming Mayor Eric Garcetti had shut down the outdoor patio at her business -- while letting a Hollywood movie crew set up an outdoor dining area just a short distance away. The shutdown at the Pineapple Hill Grill & Saloon in the city‚Äôs Sherman Oaks neighborhood came amid a county-ordered ban on outdoor dining, a mayor-issued stay-at-home order -- and California state-level plans for business shutdowns if coronavirus hospitalizations hit required levels."
Neutral,@Derek,"Over 150,000 small businesses have permanently closed over government mandated shutdowns.  We must remove governors and health departments power to disrupt economic activity.  We cannot let the media scare these politicians into permanently destroying lives."
Neutral,@Derek,Politicians who advocate for more shutdowns simply don‚Äôt understand how economics work.  You don‚Äôt get to decide what business are essential or non-essential.  Non-essential workers will run out of money and stimulus to be able to pay for essential goods and services.
Neutral,@Johncooke06,"Metropolitan police with their usual heavy handed aggressive tactics against anti Coronavirus lockdown protesters, disgusting two tier policing on show again today under Sadiq Khan's orders! Look at these left wing brainwashed cowards didn‚Äôt do that to BLM Because they are cowards he ain‚Äôt allowed to touch that guy like that despicable KHUNTS I hate the police #MetpoIice hope BLM smash them  @Simonlaur76"
Neutral,@FreedomWithJesus,"A fella's Comment was Spot On. I don't like to live a life in Conspiracy Theories. But this worldwide lock downs, and masking up. To me sounds like Conditioning and Compliance.. How Far are our Spines Going to Bend. Instead of Standing Your Ground with a Back Bone? Did You see the Fines You get For Non-compliance?  Snitch Lines?  Freedom is Essential. Will You give Away Your Rights and Freedoms? For a 99.7% Survival Rate? I do NOT plan on giving up my Rights and Freedoms.   These Are My Thoughts."
