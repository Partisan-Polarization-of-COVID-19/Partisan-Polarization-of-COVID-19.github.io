Negative,@JL92020,Peaceful Protest of Lockdown's and Governors Draconian EO's is starting to happen and needs to continue until we end the Lockdown's and take away their authority to issue EO's unless the EO is approved by Senate and President.  ⭐ Checks and Balances are needed for Governors to have the authority to issue an EO.

Positive,@and503,"Happy Thanksgiving, folk! 🦃 In the past week or two, we've heard that Democrat politicians like California Governor Gavin Newsom and New Jersey Phil Murphy, told their constituents to stay home during these holiday times. Fast forward to the future, they were caught dining with their family and friends and without their masks. And even if they were caught, they still abide with their orders.  But there is one politician that needs to be on the Wall of Shame, and that is Denver Mayor Michael Footpenis....errrr....I mean....Hancock. Hancock urged Denver residents to stay home for Thanksgiving and have themselves a small turkey instead. But this clown was caught traveling to Mississippi to see his wife and daughter. After that happened, he issued an ""apology"" to the city of Denver of his actions. But remember, peasants! Do as I say, not as I do. Again, Happy Thanksgiving! 🦃 #thanksgiving2020  #recallgavinnewsom  #recallphilmurphy  #endshutdowns  #covid19  #denver #colorado"

Positive,@GeorgiaGirl2,"Dangerous for SOME people: COVID Flu Measles Chicken pox Driving Swimming Hunting Running Drinking alcohol  Smoking Childbirth We don’t pause our entire economy or make ALL people stay home for problems SOME people have. Stop overreacting and start living.  This has never been about a virus, this has ALWAYS been about control. If you’ve ever wondered how Germans could allow their fellow Germans (Jews) to be rounded up without a fight, look around. You’re seeing it play out right in front of your eyes. Government encouraging citizens to turn in their neighbors for not following “recommendations” and laws that are blatantly unconstitutional. Just a reminder, slavery was legal; escape was not.
