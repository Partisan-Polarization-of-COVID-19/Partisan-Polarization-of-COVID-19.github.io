Positive,@GavinMcInnes,"I think one of the best takes on all this rioting and bratty behavior is Paul Joseph Watson pointing out this the daycare generation all grown up. Kids in a daycare only get attention when they scream and yell and break stuff. What did we think was going to happen? Hey moms, please stay home."
Positive,@Drainthe,Video - Joe Biden Says He Could Stay at Home During the Pandemic because Black Women Stacked Grocery Shelves -- WTH?
Neutral,@Awascom66,"It votes for the blue again, or else it gets the lockdowns again. #parler #parlerusa #wwg1wga #covid #covid19"
Neutral,@DaPoP,I hope you all see whats going on in London. They are being more american than us. Stand up and end the fucking lockdowns
Neutral,@AussieG,I donâ€™t know my country anymore. ðŸ˜ž A pregnant woman arrested for a Facebook post. Served a warrant to search and seize property in her home. Charged with incitement for organising a peaceful protest in her neighbourhood against these draconian lockdowns in Melbourne. This is not the Australia I grew up in or voted on you. Shame on you all.  #melbournelockdown #melbourne #wwg1wga
Neutral,@AdamJohnson,"Okay, my take on #Salongate . Nancy Pelosi has been mostly in San Francisco for the duration of lockdowns. It's why the WH keeps asking ""where's Nancy Pelosi"". But when she does pop up elsewhere, she's well-coiffed. This CAN'T be the first time she's done this. Just the first time she's gotten caught. And this stylist renting the chair has probably been the one doing it the whole time. Pelosi herself has said she's been to this salon many times. She just thought they would continue to break the rules for her without any influx of cash from other less privileged customers coming in and would continue to keep their mouths shut. Surprise, people need their businesses to thrive in order to eat."
Neutral,@Freedom4world,"Melbourne, Australia. A pregnant woman has her house searched, her electronics seized and is arrested by Victoria Police detectives for making a Facebook post in support of protests against the COVID lockdown."
Neutral,@EverythingConnects,"PM Jacinda Arden is the darling of the corrupt US corporate media, and late night entertainment BUT, this is what happens when a Progressive Socialist (neo-Marxist) is in charge of a (small) countryâ€™s economy. Unlike President Trump, Arden hasnâ€™t got a clue how to build an economy. Her extreme Covid lockdown continues to push New Zealand into its worst, deepest recession since 1987. #parlerusa #parleruk #parlernz #election2020"
Neutral,@Godblessgrandma,Looks like the lock down scam will soon be over and we can all get back to work. #Trump2020
