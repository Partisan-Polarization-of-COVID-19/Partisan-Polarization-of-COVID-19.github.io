Positive,@GinaGrote225,"What happened to “Stay Home, Stay Safe?” What a bunch of BS..."
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"An apartment complex in Ventura County, CA is locking their residents inside the building until all of them are tested for Covid. I called the number, was put on hold, & then eventually forwarded to voicemail. This is the dangerous slope we’ve been talking about - & it’s exactly what the Cabal wants. They don’t even have to mandate laws or draft legislation when landlords, banks, businesses, etc. will go along with the agenda & require this out of their tenants /customers. And what happens if 1 child tests positive in a public school setting? Will they lockdown that entire school until every kid is forcefully tested then shipped to a “quarantine facility” if positive? This is called tyranny & it never ends up well for us citizens. It’s time to wake up & fight for our God-given rights. #WWG1WGA"
Neutral,@Evaluation,"My name is Anthony Fauci. I was wrong on masks. Wrong on lockdowns. Wrong on Hydroxychloroquine. I single-handedly robbed millions of work, income, and time."
Neutral,@Dogwithabone,All the BLM protests was always going to cause case rises but they were all proud to say the risk of Corona was worth it to protest what they believed in. Will they be saying that if their loved ones get ill?  #alllivesmatter #antifabullshit #Boris  : Bradford and London boroughs among 36 'at-risk' areas that could be 'just days away' from local lockdowns
