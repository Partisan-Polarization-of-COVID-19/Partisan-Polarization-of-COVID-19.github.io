Negative,@BrodenNielson1776,"About 7-8 months ago we had lockdowns nearly everywhere to stop the spread of the virus. Those same lockdowns put more people on welfare, made more people do drugs, made more people depressed and caused 60% of small businesses to close. Those lockdowns went on for weeks and the virus is still around. What makes democrats think it’s going to work this time?! #2020election  #endlockdowns  #tyranny  #trump2020"

Positive,@ConnorMulvey,"Just a reminder that the people who have fled socialism, communism and government oppression, did NOT vote for Joe Biden, despite the supposed xenophobe in the White House. All you people who have bathed in the fruits of capitalism under this administration but voted for your geriatric marxist savior, better get ready for a big change. Your white, bougie lifestyle is coming under attack. Your favorite little brunch spots will close (bring on higher taxes & a national lockdown), oil prices will skyrocket (no more offshore drilling), and purchasing power is going to take a hit. Bye bye “girls trips” on impulse. If most of you weren’t so poorly informed and governed by facts instead of emotion, you’d probably put two and two together and wish for the return of the Orange Man. However, your submission to your alleged victimhood will never allow you to get past yourself and you’ll always stay in the dark, yearning for more taxes and a larger nanny state. #parler #lowinformationvoters #usa"

Neutral,@HeadBunWarmer,Global Supply chains are beginning to choke off supply.  Remember the toilet paper outage? It’s back. Global companies that are loyal to the UN Agenda 2030 are choking off supplies in an effort to create a panic and starve us into submission.  I have been warning for weeks about the potential of meat shortages and lockdowns and it looks like we are at that point now.  Join The Local Meat Club and ensure that your family has meat and pastures dairy. We will pause our membership after the next 35 members.  So get in and secure your food supply. www.localmeatclub.com

While the day before the dance in the streets with thousands. They closed our church's because of gatherings They gather and march to protest. This in no longer about your safety. This is a attempt to control you, and its working. The best way to take control over a people and control them utterly is to take a little of their freedom at a time, to erode rights by a thousand tiny and almost imperceptible reductions. In this way, the people will not see those rights and freedoms being removed until past the point at which these changes cannot be reversed...  Echo..echo..echo.."
