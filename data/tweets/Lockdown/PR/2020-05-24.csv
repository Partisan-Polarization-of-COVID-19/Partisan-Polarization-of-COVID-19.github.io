Positive,@jamesctheman,I'm really sick of hearing every commercial on every piece of media I use telling me to stay home.  Social distance. Wash my hands.  Wear a mask.  I'm sick of hearing that we're alone together.  Seriously?  There's no together.  They've spent the last 3 years splitting us apart and now you want me to love they neighbor?  Fuck you.
