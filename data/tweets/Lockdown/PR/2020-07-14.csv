Negative,@Fang1957,This is ridiculous! More testing = more cases! Deaths are down by 90% and that’s even assuming all the original ‘COVID’ deaths were actually from COVID. Most new cases are asymptomatic. It’s time for civil disobedience folks! No masks - no shutdowns - no more social distancing. Back to normal for the USA!

Neutral,@Aussiebrad,"More cases today in Victoria than the whole country had in a single day in March at the Australian peak of the covid-19... All because the state government let people leave quarantine without a test and sub-contractors with no training were used for security in the quarantine hotels... Ill keep repeating it. Victorians keep voting this CCP loving, extreme left government in. They can deal with a consequences."
Neutral,@Aussiebrad,"As usual, no data provided on hopitalisation or death rates.... But in all honest, this is why you dont shit where you eat. This was all caused by decisions made by the leftwing Victorian government.... Melbourne, you continue to vote the fools in, you can deal with the consequences of #lockdowns, Labor Party corruption, #ccp Belts and Roads initiative, #unemployment and #hightaxes.... the rest of #Australia shouldnt suffer. #auspol"
Neutral,@Joker1961,And according to our local deaths vs the regular flu it warrants no masks or shutdowns. This is woolens trying to socialize us
