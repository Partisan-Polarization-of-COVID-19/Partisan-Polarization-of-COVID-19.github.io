Negative,@AmyDC,Reopen America! Latest data shows the lockdowns by Democratic governors are purely political!
Negative,@HapaGirl,"Let‚Äôs get something straight. This is not an eulogy, it‚Äôs a Democrat rally masking as an eulogy. Trump needs to do his rallies now. #covid is officially canceled proven by the 500 plus people at the fake eulogy. Open America now and let‚Äôs go. Leave all the stupid brainwashed people behind and let them stay in their feelings. #georgefloyd #trump2020 #democratsaredestroyingamerica #voteredtosaveamerica #georgefloydhoax"
Negative,@Forgetaboutit2020,#Truth We must FIGHT!  #NoLockdowns #TrumpRallys #Trump2020
Positive,@0IIIIIII0GIRL,"Look at this news article from The Daily Caller: DC Mayor Tells Residents To Stay Home For 4th Of July, Promotes Black Lives Matter Gatherings She is a disgrace, come and protest without masks but don‚Äôt ‚Äòsocially distance‚Äô whilst celebrating our Country‚Äôs Birthday!"
Positive,@ChampSu,"Off my usual topic, I have a question: What makes your day? (Light stuff, not ""my kids/my wonderful spouse...these things are a given.) My favorite ""makes my day""? The Geico commercial with Marco Polo. The only commercial I can watch all the way through without hearing ""we are all in this together/stay home/wear a mask 24-7/etc. Io sono Marco Polo! üòÇ"
Positive,@HapaGirl,"I‚Äôm beyond angry right now. Why does #georgefloyd get to have several memorials and a massive 3 hours funeral that‚Äôs freaking televised live? Plus a 12 mile procession? Have all the intelligent people gone crazy? Wtf? The very same ppl who told us to stay home or else we were selfish & would kill everyone are at his freaking funeral sitting shoulder to shoulder!! Wtf is that?? Just turned to Fox & Sharpton isn‚Äôt eulogizing shit, he‚Äôs talking about racism as usual. The more shit like this I see the more I believe the conspiracy theories. Any sane person think this is crazy or is it just me? #alsharpton can kiss my ass, nothing but a race baiter."
Neutral,@Amyvennon,"If our governors force us to quarantine again, it won‚Äôt be to protect us from a fake virus. It‚Äôs a power trip and nothing else!"
Neutral,@claynrobinson,"Looking to travel to New York, New Jersey, or Connecticut soon? You may have to quarantine upon arrival after governors from all three states announced that travelers from states with increased coronavirus cases must isolate themselves for two weeks. #newyork #newjersey #connecticut #coronavirus #covid19 #parler"
Neutral,@4651lainey,"Scare people with a virus. Put them in quarantine. House arrest. Count the number of dead every second every day in every news headline. Close businesses. 40,000,000 out of jobs. Peak unemployment. Remove entertainment parks, Gyms, bars, restaurants, sports. No dating,touching,Mask people, Dehumanize them, Close temples, churches, Let depression,anxiety, desperation set in. Then... Ignite hatred, civil unrest. Empty prisons, fill the streets with criminals. I would say there are those orchestrating the downfall of America. We must wake up, come together, not let them.‚Äù WE ARE AMERICAN 'S WE CAN DO ANYTHING with God's Help . WE fought war's and WE always WON . We are a chosen generation . We live at this time because we were chosen . WE CAN do this. copied /Pasted  Thanks Gina Stoke"
Neutral,@Jamierodr14,FINALLY!  FRAUD & LIAR Fauci Admits Widespread Lockdowns Not Needed In U.S. Stop the insanity!  I'm ready to get our economy growing & sick of the disinformation by the Left & Media!  Democrats want to Destroy America by tanking our economy!  Echo if you agree  @Laura   @katthehammer1  @ClintonMichael
