Positive,@JHrusky,"What do these idiots expect the world to do? Stay home for the next 1, 2, 4 years until a vaccine is not only developed, but tested, ensured safe, and given to billions of people? Is that the plan?  Yes, the virus is here.  Yes, it is going to stay here and not go away.  Yes, more people will get infected.  Yes, more people have already been infected. But people cannot live in a bubble.  People have to leave their homes. People have to buy supplies. People have to work.  And people have to interact."
Positive,@Grizzgrumps,"Imagine you were born in 1900. When you're 14, World War I begins and ends when you're 18 with 22 million dead. Soon after a global pandemic, the Spanish Flu, appears, killing 50 million people. And you're alive and 20 years old. When you're 29 you survive the global economic crisis that started with the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange, causing inflation, unemployment and famine. When you're 33 years old the nazis come to power. When you're 39, World War II begins and ends when you're 45 years old with a 60 million dead. In the Holocaust 6 million Jews die. When you're 52, the Korean War begins. When you're 64, the Vietnam War begins and ends when you're 75. A child born in 1985 thinks his grandparents have no idea how difficult life is, but they have survived several wars and catastrophes. Today we have all the comforts in a new world, amid a new pandemic. But we complain because we need to wear Masks, Get paid to stay Home etc Today a Spoilt Woke Society. WAKE THE FUCK UP ðŸ˜ "
Neutral,@Amyvennon,"If our governors force us to quarantine again, it wonâ€™t be to protect us from a fake virus. Itâ€™s a power trip and nothing else!"
Neutral,@ChrisAdler,Quarantine is when you restrict the movement of sick people... Tyranny is when you restrict the movement of healthy people! We are Americans and we will not tolerate this! Echo if you agree
Neutral,@aalaeh,"Trump should have said lock down everything and the demos would scream open up the economy. Trump should support BLM, and the demos would denounce it. We should keep schools closed, the demos will want them open. They do the exact opposite of whatever Trump says. My point? They are the reason for the divide. Sorry about stating the obvious."
