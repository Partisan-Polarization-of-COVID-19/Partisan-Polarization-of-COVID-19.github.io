Positive,@fordg,how many #patriots bitching about #covid #lockdowns and #masks but you are using as #excuse to #workfromhome ? #hypocrites need to get back to work.
Neutral,@Chickapea60,"Democrat Lockdowns Exempt Hollywood, Destroy Small Businesses | Frontpagemag"
Neutral,@Catspaw,All great questions. I think it will require individual business owners to defy the lockdowns & open anyway. They can’t arrest everyone.
Neutral,@Directorate,"#Trump declaring Martial Law would likely be less restrictive than Dem covid ""lockdowns"" which are China's biowarfare & economic attack on the world, but mainly upon the USA - the only nation with DONALD TRUMP to stand between them and their global conquest! #STOPTHESTEAL #RELEASETHEKRAKEN #MARTIALLAW #KAG #MAGA #DIRECTORATE #CHINA #ECHO #PARLER"
Neutral,@created2worship,"As a previous banker and now Accountant, I would advise everyone to remove your money. The communist left are after us and if they are not successful with keeping us silent they will hit us financially. They already hurt us financially with the shutdowns, next will be account freezing. You all already know who owns most of our banking corporations 👉Soros! This is just my suggestion but each individual needs to make that choice for themselves. I myself am only going to keep just enough in there that covers my bills and the rest is coming out!"
