Neutral,@GrizzNasty78,"People, it‚Äôs time to get some will power and backbone.... -STOP using Twitter, FaceBook, or any other Fuckerberg or Jack Dorshit owned social media. Let it go. It is a cancer! Now...as far as I know...Parler appears legit. -Leave these ‚Äúnews media‚Äù channels behind...FOX, CNN, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, etc. Find alternatives! They are out there...do your research. I myself have been watching NEWSMAX.  -STOP wearing masks!! The pandemic is a f*cking SCAM!Refuse these lockdowns! Government does NOT own us! We DO NOT answer to them, THEY answer to US!  -Stop giving $$$ to streaming sites such as HULU, Netflix, Disney, and others that exploit children and openly promote pedophilia. Do some research! Remember, there was a time when we had NONE of those things and we were just fine! We have been programmed to NEED these things! WE DO NOT! What we need is EACH OTHER...OUR FAMILIES...LOVE...UNITY...TOGETHERNESS!! This IS achievable, we were made in GODS image. And he is a GOD of LOVE!  God Bless!!"
Neutral,@CraigTheTechTeacher,"""Under the best circumstances, 50% of all small businesses fail in their first five years. Over 100,000 businesses are estimate to have closed for good due to economic shutdowns. Restaurants are the hardest hit among the over 22 million jobs lost from the shutdowns. Many restaurants are small business owned and managed. Let's also not forget, many small business owners operate on thin margins and can only ""float"" paychecks, overhead, invoices, receivables, and losses for 60 to 90 days. All of this spells sleepless nights to the heroes who keep our economy running."" #Economy #Shutdowns #Biden #Trump #Economics #Reopen #Election #Election2020 #Truth #Media #FakeNews #MSM"
