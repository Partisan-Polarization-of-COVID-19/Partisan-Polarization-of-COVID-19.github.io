Call your local politicians (State and Federal).  Tell them you want transparency.  Tel them you want the lockdowns to end.  Tell State lawmakers to take back Cuomos unchecked power over the lives of millions of us as he continues to completely collapse our economy and cast us into oblivion.  The time is now.  Not tomorrow.  Not after Trump wins his court cases.  Not after Christmas.  Now.

Positive,@DominicDeBona,"Man fucking government paying me to stay home? Sounds like a dream. No, not a dream. A nightmare. They’re paying you to stay home(probably with the taxes you already give to the government. Too). I don’t really have many words to be honest. It’s disgusting behaviour. And ahistorical, throughout governments take from you not give. Why are you paying us to stay home and who’s fucking money are you giving us. AOC, let’s be honest. You are probably one of the stupidest people on the planet.(probably think sticking your hand in the microwave is a good way to warm your body.) Your socialist shit won’t work here. And it won’t work on me. You can’t fuck your way out of this one. I wonder who’s dick you sucked to become a congresswoman anyways. Because you definitely didn’t get it because of your intelligence or character. Wow bit of a rant. Paying millions of people to stay home. Sounds good on paper, but basic economics means it won’t work. Not for long anyways."

It is amazing but that is completely looked down upon now...if the woman isn’t chasing money all day, she’s a waste. I have a part time job but FAMILY IS 100 percent more important!!!!!!

Neutral,@DawgFerale,"All of these democrat mayors, governors, etc., reinstating lockdowns, banning Thanksgiving, limiting indoor gatherings to 10 or less and perpetuating this lie are blithering idiots who are not interested one iota in your safety. They could care less whether you live or die, they just want to control you. I’ve said this from day one of this virus thing, the lockdowns have never been about protecting your health, they’ve all been about control."
Neutral,@GeoffMcKenzie,"Follow me here... 1) Covid has never been a pandemic. It has always been about control! 2) Masks and lockdowns have never been about your health. They have always been about teaching you to submit to unreasonable demands. 3) Covid, masks, lockdowns, and censorship were designed to break our spirit so we would let them steal the election and would do nothing to stop them. They made one Yuge mistake: they underestimated the resiliency of the American spirit! I think this ""pandemic"" was planned for a Clinton presidency, and might have worked. But the globalists didn't see Trump coming and how he would invigorate the populist love of America. Rise up! Speak out! Americans do not kneel! We fight! No justice! No peace!"

Nearly 7,000 residents in North Carolina were told via text message last week that they tested positive for the Coronavirus despite not actually having contracted the disease.

Neutral,@Jaysonveley,"I’m telling you right now, there’s going to be a growing movement against the covid lockdowns, restrictions and regulations. People are not going to put up with politicians telling them where they can go, how many people they can have in their homes, whether or not they wear masks in their homes, whether or not they can go to churches or synagogues, whether or not they can keep their business open, etc. We are Americans. Fighting for freedom is in our DNA."
Neutral,@GalwayGal,Lockdowns are getring more invasive because we're exposing the election CHEAT - DEMS are running scared so they pull old CV-19 card again. In CA they moved us back to purple tier and locking down AGAIN (despite our ahole Gov out partying with friends!) yet when I run the stats same positive infection rate (6.5%) of those tested and 99% recovery rate! The stats haven't changed just more people being tested!!!

Slavery of white people for a few hundred years. Think that's impossible? How far into the 2-week lockdowns to ""flatten the curve"" have you lasted? The truth is not their goal. As always, it's based in their craving for absolute power."

Simply put, it has become a political tool used to drive a narrative of fear and despair, to pit neighbor against neighbor and usher in a tyrannical, intrusive and controlling form of government. Where it has been most ferociously, and strictly embraced, it has been for one and only one reason to control the minds and actions of the populations for political and personal gain. The Newsomes party, the Cuomos get $25,000/yr raises, the Pelosi prospers from crooked voting systems, and the tech tyrants wallow in cash and disinformation to confuse, misdirect and fan the flames of fear. All to CONTROL THE MINDS OF PEOPLE THEY SEE ONLY AS LAB RATS TO BE MANIPULATE FOR GAIN! “WAKE UP AMERICA JUST SAY NO MORE!”"

The globalist had hoped to use CLIMATE CHANGE HOAX, to usher in our self enslavement, with its mandatory shutdowns, but were forced to speed up the plans with the CORONA virus. Make no mistake about it, call it conspiracy theory if you will, but then look at the facts, and history of what brought us here to this point! Economy roaring, everyone prospering, the left tried four other COUP D'ETAT attempts, all of a sudden in marches the perfect excuse to shut it all down, we survived, now we are watching mass election fraud, the like that has never been seen, and we are to believe there is no conspiracy?

Neutral,@GreatConservativeNews,So what will they do when the jobs are gone. When businesses shut down. When people start lining up for food. When people move under bridges. The damage that has been done so far is huge. I know many people a hair away from losing it all. Should have never locked down in the first place. Trumps initial instinct was to not lock down. They kept harassing him. The so called experts told him he must lock down. Should have focused on the old and sick and let everyone else continue on. Now we are how many more trillion in debt? How much damage has been done? I tell you these people are communist and want to take down this country.
