Neutral,@DanSmith,I hope the best for President Trump and the First Lady after their positive test for the Corona Virus. He has lived a healthy life so the fact that he has no underlying conditions makes me hopeful that he will make it through this obstacle. President Trump has been burning the candles at both ends so maybe having the ability to take some time off for a quarantine period will recharge his batteries for the final leg of the campaign before the election. Reading the Twitter comments again speaks to how the Democratic Party and their groupthink ilk have devolved from the party of compassion to the party of pettiness and spite. A lot of people really dislike our president without ever having met him. That means the media's coverage of him is their only vestibule to who he is and the followers of the mainstream media will not consider the extreme bias that is used in their reporting.
