Negative,@FreeEarthlings,"Dr. #ReinerFuellmich on #PCRtestScandal  The #Covid19Crisis must be renamed a #CoronaScandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages. How dangerous is the virus? What is the significance of a positive #PCRtest? What is the collateral damage with respect to #health and #economy? An international network of lawyers will argue the biggest #TortCase ever - the #CoronaFraudScandal - which has unfolded into probably the greatest #CrimesAgainstHumanity ever committed. #Scientists and #lawyers recognise that as a result of the deliberate panic-mongering and the corona measures enabled by this panic, #democracy is in great danger of being replaced by #FascistTotalitarian models. To make sure that no one will ever again be in a position of such power as to be able to defraud humanity, or to attempt to manipulate us with their corrupt agendas. #SaveTheEconomy #DefendHumanity #EndLockdowns  #MakeLawLawfulAgain  #GetOffOurRights"

Negative,@Centaur,"Anti lockdown freedom rally, this Saturday 31st October in Victoria Square, Birmingham 1pm."
Positive,@2ndAmendment4Me,Thousands more people die from the flu EVERY YEAR not just a few months in a lifetime! No masks ppl get over it in a week and go back to normal life. Common sense if you are sick stay home. Not wearing masks will help ppl become immune to a virus!
Positive,@AZCowboyConstitutionalist,"Just like 2016, all of the media outlets are predicting a victory for Joe Biden in an attempt to get us all to stay home. Not once have I or anyone I know ever received a call from a pollster. Last night I went to a dinner party and met two couples that were Democrats voting for Trump. So interesting hearing their perspectives. They brought it up. How many Biden stickers do you all see out there? They aint gonna show! We will like never before!!!"
Neutral,@dumbgrunt007,Breaking news Joe Biden tests positive for dandruff. He will quarantine until after the election.
Neutral,@ALX,"Chris Cuomo is offended that President Trump took his mask off on his balcony. When Cuomo had the Virus, he broke quarantine, threatened a biker, infected his family, and staged himself leaving his basement for “the first time” on air misleading his viewers."

Neutral,@ardevinewriter,Ireland on the verge of possible second lockdown. It is impossible to halt the spread of Covid without a vaccine which might never come. Full lockdowns merely kick the can down the road. Destroying the economy & people's lives for a virus that even in severe cases now unlikely to lead to death is a monumental act of self harm.
Neutral,@ChrisMatei,"The @WHO just backtracked on lockdowns, stating that lockdowns do not help at all.  Well, thanks WHO! Took you 9 months. $83 Trillion wiped out. 150M children pushed into poverty. Millions of suicides. Hundreds of millions who lost their job. Where’s the media? #powertrip"
Neutral,@Angry10,Joe Biden (LIEUTENANT LOCKDOWN)) wants continued Lockdowns. Trump wants to open the country back up and protect our seniors and those with underlying medical issues that may be vulnerable. THERE IS A VAST DIFFERENCE . !! Vote for Trump or Hiden Biden will put everyone out of work and many more will suffer from this virus !  The cure cannot be worse than the Virus !!!! #LIEUTENANTLOCKDOWN #Sleepy Joe #draintheswamp  #HorribleHunter #BidenCrimeFamily.

Neutral,@JackvoteTrump,The Cares Act has disproportionately helped blue states that imposed stricter coronavirus lockdowns and have been slower to recover economically.

Neutral,@GallantlyStreaming,"Share this video with anyone and everyone. Lawyer presents case for biggest class action lawsuit ever against those creating lockdowns, spreading fear, forcing masks, etc. in conjunction with COVID-19"
Neutral,@Arby1987,"I'm getting really sick of hearing about these stupid COVID-19 restrictions all over the place. I hate having to spend my day wearing a mask and literally coming home with a sore throat due to that mask. 6 feet my hind-end! I've seen more crowding on public transit and in Walmarts than I have in public places, with AND without masks. Plus, the stupid hospitals like Kaiser Permanente are advocating for these COVID-19 lockdowns and measures when COVID-19 has LITERALLY a less than 3% chance of being dangerous (yes, I actually did the math, thanks for asking). I'd rather be sick with a cold knowing that it's worse than a coronavirus than be locked up in a shed over a virus that I may or may not catch."
Neutral,@Bostonbashers09,"How can anyone untangle the large tennacles of the Deep State? Who is included in theDeep State? Large American Corporations, politicians of Both Parties and Mega rich American Families. The National Media, They constantly rant about low corporate taxes, as a diversion. ABC is owned by Disney, NBC is owned by Comcast, CNN is owned by AT&T and Jeff Bezos Of Amazon owns the Washington Post. Now why would these huge corporations be against Capitalism? Why would they support Progressive, Socialist Democrats? Easy it is their goal to make the United States an Authoritarian Government. The easiest way is to use the Democratic Party and their base of uninformed constituents. Afterall, it was Hillary who said, Democrats were easy to manipulate! Why do these corporations Bank roll the unrest in this country? Do you notice the Covid Lockdown didn’t hurt their bottom line? Can you see the ultimate goal is to control the American people. Can you see the breakdown of the Bill of Rights?"

Neutral,@AmericanCrusade2020,"Impulse thought: If Roe v Wade was primarily rooted in a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, the same can be said with the CoViD shutdowns. Oh, the W.H.O. is by and large against shutdowns!  The Fourteenth Amendment clause guaranteeing that no state shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” #fourteenthamendment #covid #shutdown #worldhealthorganization #roevwade"
Neutral,@DaveTheCave,Republicans and Democrats have been profligate with our tax dollars for decades. Now is the time for both to come together to bail out small businesses and unemployed that are in a mess because of government shutdowns. If Republicans have to bend a little to keep businesses open and those who are unemployed solvent so what. Once this pandemic is finished my thought is that both parties will return to their corrupt spending practices and require more tax dollars to do so. Hopefully Trump the outsider will win a second term and put us back on a strong fiscal course.
Neutral,@Johncooke06,More footage of the met police with their heavy handed aggressive tactics against anti Coronavirus lockdown protesters in central London today.  Keep in mind only yesterday Nigerians were protesting outside Buckingham palace and not a policeman in sight. The despicable disgusting brainwashed KHUNTS known as the police I find the police in London to be totally infiltrated by Antifa and left wing brainwashed cowards including the City of London police they despise the working class . How can Labour voters vote for that KHUNT Sadiq Khan forget the party these people on numerous occasions now have been smashed by the police on his and Cressida Dicks orders he is not fit for purpose The Police are so thick BLM despise them but they want to protect them BLM want to defund them I can’t wait for the next BLM OR RAVE and see the police running like the true cowards that they are smash them to kingdom come who cares I despise them .#MetPolice. #sadiqkhan #cressidadick  @Simonlaur76   @Sal72H
Neutral,@Gebhardjb9,"The virus is raging in Europe right now. I heard they are going to go with the dumb fuck lock downs again... smfh. That's right, destroy yourselves over a virus that's 99%+ survivable. What the fuck is wrong with these stupid mother fuckers and why the fuck are people going along with it? Europe is heading for disaster, and if biden gets in we will be headed down the same dumb fuck path. The stupidity is getting out of control fear is clouding people's minds. It's the media that is the enemy not the virus. Just my thoughts."
