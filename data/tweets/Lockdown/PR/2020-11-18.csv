Negative,@Americas1776,The Hypocrisy! California Governor Gavin Newsom has been demanding people stay indoors and cancel holidays but meanwhile he was recently seen celebrating a birthday over dinner at a restaurant.  Truly disturbing to see these governors going against restrictions they put into place. This is all about control over the public.  #covid19hoax #liberalhypocrisy #covid #governor #liberalsmustgo #lockdown #maga #california #trump2020 #endthelockdown #covidrestrictions
Negative,@Chiaramonte,Who can explain this one?  With the second wave of lockdowns starting to roll in. I know for my state Big Gretch is trying to push us around again. Many people I know are not going to stand for it.  We know the virus is real.  We know we all have a risk.  But don’t tell us we can’t see our family for the holidays. That’s our call as a family to decide if the risk of being sick is worth it or not.  Not the Governments job. It’s ours.  #michiganlockdown  #covid19  #endthelockdown  ECHO IF YOU AGREE!

Positive,@buskirk,"The Biden-Harris Team is already talking about 4-6 weeks of new national lockdowns if they take office.  Remember when it was 2 weeks to slow the spread?  Remember when if you just wore a mask, we wouldn't have to lockdown? (We've had mask mandates for months) Remember when we just needed better treatments and a vaccine? (Regeneron is widely available & multiples vaccines will be available before inauguration day. China has a widely distributed vaccine already) But still...they want to lock you in your house, stop your life, keep you away from church and your loved ones.  No."
