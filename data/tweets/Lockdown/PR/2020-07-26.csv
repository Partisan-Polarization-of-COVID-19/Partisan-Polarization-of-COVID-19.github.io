Negative,@9180ky,"Fake News, Fake Fauci, Fake swamp dwellers, Fake tyrant libtard governors, local elected officials, and unelected bureaucrats. #nomoremasks #nomorelockdowns. I'm done with them and their asinine policies and illegal dictates."
Negative,@9180ky,"Search YouTube for ""American Doctors"" and you should see a thumbnail of a black woman in a white lab coat. I would share it but the MARXISTS at YouTube can't let the narrative about the Chinese Cooties be destroyed by the facts. The video I saw today was in front of the supreme court (until Roberts is gone, I don't see the need to capitalize it) with several of America's front line doctors treating the Kung Flu. If after watching the video of their conference, you don't see this ""epidemic/pandemic"" for the fake news that it is, then you must still be waiting for Adam Schiff to release all the good stuff on President Trump about Russian collusion and despicable Ukrainian quid pro quo deals. While you are waiting, do the world a favor and self isolate youself. I hear if you get a computer virus, you're a 1000 times more likely to get and die from the Sweet and Sour sicken. So don't get online for anything. I read it on reddit or was it wikipedia. #nomoremasks #nomorelockdowns"

Positive,@Castaneda0418,"@GovRonDeSantis  REOPEN PALM BEACH COUNTY SCHOOLS. Enough!!  @DanBongino  I think you would agree, no? Parents can’t afford to stay home. We have jobs."
Positive,@GunLovingLiberal,"For the record, saying that you don’t need to wear a mask in public because people over 60 can just stay home all the time (if they’re scared) is just as stupid as people who say that police should respond to lethal threats with shots targeting the legs."
Positive,@BeQiStiles,"If God thought we would all be healthier with face masks for the rest of our lives, he would have created us with them permanently attached to our bodies at birth. You have a God given immune system that has a purpose. You should be allowed to strengthen it and use it to its full purpose. Are you sick? Stay home? It’s time we saw smiles and facial expressions again. The dehumanizing of the world is happening right before our eyes and under our covered up noses. It’s as plain as the smile on your face that we are no longer allowed to see. What the liberals say is temporary, they will surely soon make permanent."
Positive,@AmericanaFauna,"WHAT IF (hang in here with me) What if the reason that Biden is a walking gaff, the reason he’s waiting till the 11th hour you’re pick a VP, it be switched with someone else (because let’s face it. Even if it happens today that person has 4 months to campaign with a party who is trying to not campaign because it goes against the rhetoric of stay home, mail in vote).  What if it’s because the DNC is already done and they know it. What if this is some show, and this is scorched earth tactics. What if this is all just to wake up people, but the fates of politicians, elites, and stars are already sealed? Am I the only one? #qanon #q #wwg1wga"
Positive,@DarlenePoole,#MAGA #Parler #Parlerusa #Trump2020 #Saveamerica Conservatives don’t protest typically. (silent majority) and at this point - we should. We need to shake things up—— and do something we NEVER do! We should be showing our displeasure of what’s going on!!!! All we are doing (me included) is just becoming texting warriors complaining!!!! We need to rise up and organize events to get us together protest - whatever we have to do- to get out there. We are allowing the government to take our freedoms away. Remember - they just wanted us to stay home to flatten the curve—-the curve has been long flattened. They are taking advantage of all of us POLITICALLY. And because we are allowing it—— they will do it anytime they deem fit!!! Put us on lockdown for every flu- for every sniffle at election year. Enough is enough!! The President can’t do this all by himself and the Republican Party is literally—- hiding and doing NOTHING!! SILENT MAJORITY—- WAKE UP!!!!!
Neutral,@Jlat73,"If masks really work, why quarantine people?"
Neutral,@ALX,This is insane. Couple under house arrest after refusing to sign COVID-19 quarantine agreement
Neutral,@BFilo166,Kentucky couple who won’t self quarantine put under house arrest! This is full blown unconstitutional tyranny! #scamdemic
Neutral,@ChrisAdler,Quarantine is when you restrict the movement of sick people... Tyranny is when you restrict the movement of healthy people! We are Americans and we will not tolerate this! Echo if you agree
Neutral,@Georgethepatriot,"Just to let everyone know, I work in a nursing home. We were contacted by the CDC. We had to prepare a quarantine for residents with c19. We haven’t tested in over three weeks. We have no cases but we are having to prepare like the Black Plague is coming. There’s nothing to prepare for. When we were testing we had 8 residents with it and none had any symptoms and no one died. I said all that to say this, get ready, the deep state is about to make a huge push to scare everyone again. It WILL be FAKE. Don’t fall for it. The virus is pretty much gone. To reiterate, we are building a ward for c19, we are wearing mask and face shields. We haven’t had to wear face shields since it began. This was all recommended by the CDC. It’s complete nonsense. You have been warned."
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"An apartment complex in Ventura County, CA is locking their residents inside the building until all of them are tested for Covid. I called the number, was put on hold, & then eventually forwarded to voicemail. This is the dangerous slope we’ve been talking about - & it’s exactly what the Cabal wants. They don’t even have to mandate laws or draft legislation when landlords, banks, businesses, etc. will go along with the agenda & require this out of their tenants /customers. And what happens if 1 child tests positive in a public school setting? Will they lockdown that entire school until every kid is forcefully tested then shipped to a “quarantine facility” if positive? This is called tyranny & it never ends up well for us citizens. It’s time to wake up & fight for our God-given rights. #WWG1WGA"

Neutral,@calthorpe001,"Look at this highly dangerous individual. Apparently, we've all been getting educated about how British society actually works, instead of dying from Covid-19. Future lockdowns will clearly involve censorship, if this lunatic has anything to do with it. The mountain to protect free speech is a steep one, and one that MUST be climbed."

Neutral,@JFVolz,"Want to #impeachjayinslee or #impeachcuomo or #impeachkatebrown ? We should be looking beyond their terms. Each of these Governors has taken actions to violate our Constitutional Rights, and have largely been allowed to do so by a soft generation who just rolled over. The US Constitution is unique in that it places restrictions on the Government. It is time for us all to look at State Constitutions, and work with our Representatives to limit/restrict the power of our Governors. Get them out our churches, our schools and out businesses. Keep this thread going and share ideas. They are taking notes on what works and what doesn’t. After the Wuhan virus is done with, they will find other causes to keep folks locked down jumping through unconstitutional hoops. You don’t think there will be “climate change” lockdowns? They have this power and won’t give it up. We must take it from them. They work for us, not the other way around."
