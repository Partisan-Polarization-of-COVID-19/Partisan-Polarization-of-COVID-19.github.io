Neutral,@CraigTheTechTeacher,"""Under the best circumstances, 50% of all small businesses fail in their first five years. Over 100,000 businesses are estimate to have closed for good due to economic shutdowns. Restaurants are the hardest hit among the over 22 million jobs lost from the shutdowns. Many restaurants are small business owned and managed. Let's also not forget, many small business owners operate on thin margins and can only ""float"" paychecks, overhead, invoices, receivables, and losses for 60 to 90 days. All of this spells sleepless nights to the heroes who keep our economy running."" #Economy #Shutdowns #Biden #Trump #Economics #Reopen #Election #Election2020 #Truth #Media #FakeNews #MSM"

Neutral,@Gater1967,"I contend that the Coronavirus pandemic didn‚Äôt just ‚Äúhappen‚Äù, that it was an act of biological warfare perpetrated by the Chinese communist regime and the Democratic Party. It brought about the shutdowns which gave the Democrats the narrative of blaming Trump for bad economic numbers and created the justification for the increased mail-in voting which allowed them to employ the massive voter fraud which we are now seeing."
Neutral,@Heatherp719,"The virus paved a pathway for the Democrats to totally destroy our election system, knowing that with the virus our post offices would be under staffed and people on ""lock down"" would make it so much easier to rig this election. ü¶Üü¶Üüí©"
