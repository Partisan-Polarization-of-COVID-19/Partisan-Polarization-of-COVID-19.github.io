Negative,@Berau,Even as a non Christian I feel a pretty profound sadness when I see the livestreams of mass/sermons in empty churches.

Negative,@Americas1776,LOCKDOWN Scam!  The first wave of lockdown was to crush the local businesses and this final wave of lockdowns is to finish off those businesses. This virus is all made up and has been blown way out of proportion.  They are doing this to make independent employment nearly impossible and make everyone dependent on the government. THIS IS ALL ABOUT CONTROL!!!!! ECHO this!

Negative,@bpeterssquare,"America used to be the land of the free and the home of the brave. Now we are the land of lockdowns and home of the afraid.  How do you think the Democrats kept their slaves on the plantation in chains? FEAR.  The former slave owning Democrats made their slaves terrified of what would happen to them if they tried to escape. And even if they did, the slave was told they were incapable of surviving without their white master.  Is this any different than the FEAR used by Democrats to lock you down in your home like a slave?  Tyrants, dictators and totalitarians have only one tool for control; FEAR.  Democrats have always been this way.  This is a second lockdown for some. Do you really think they will stop here?  Are you free?  Are you brave?  Or are you allowing the FEAR they‚Äôre selling you to place chains on your freedom?  #lockdown #endthelockdown #resisttyranny #masksareforslaves #nomasks #covid19 #pandemic #coronavirus #coronavirushoax #election2020 #electionfraud"

Negative,@bpeterssquare,"Carbon dioxide does not only cause asphyxiation by hypoxia but also acts as a toxicant. At high concentrations, it has been showed to cause unconsciousness almost instantaneously and respiratory arrest within 1 min.  The term ‚Äúconfined space hypoxic syndrome‚Äù has been proposed to describe confined space accidents occurring in water meter pits, tanks, holds of ships, mines, underground storage bins, and so forth, resulting from oxygen-deficient atmospheres.  A recent study of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 2015 still estimated the number of deaths involving confined spaces to be around 90 per year.  Without adequate treatment, victims may show acute reduced cognitive performance, respiratory failure, and circulatory arrest. #nomasks #masksdontwork #masksareforslaves #election2020 #covd19 #pandemic #coronavirus #coronavirushoax #lockdown #endthelockdown #endtheshutdown #reopenamerica #health #wellness #fightback #patriotsfight #maga #wewillwin"

The ‚Äúscience‚Äù says that the majority of people accounting for new cases wear masks ‚Äúall of the time‚Äù. Proving that masks don‚Äôt work.

Neutral,@Conservattorney,"As we continue to be bombarded by the media pushing a Biden White House, we hear about mask mandates and shutdowns.  What the news media refuse to report is that mask mandates do not work, and in fact may be contributing to the spread of COVID.  Don't believe me, then read this report BY THE CDC and buried on their own website:  Mask wearers will touch their face on a more consistent basis than non-mask wearers. We know the virus enters the body through the mouth and nose. Additional reports indicate that transmission via ""droplets in the air"" are highly unlikely as they are nearly impossible to detect even in lab conditions. But touching your face repeatedly to put your mask on, take it off, adjust it, etc. brings your hands close to your mouth and nose, thus making it easier for the virus to come in contact or close proximity to susceptible membranes.  So the question is, why keep pushing mask mandates?"

Neutral,@9180ky,"COVID-19 is a hoax perpetrated by swamp dwelling bureaucrats in NIH and CDC. It's less deadly than the flu. The 230k deaths is GREATLY EXAGGERATED. Ask yourself if masks and social distancing work then why are we seeing rise CASE counts? Why is it not RISING MORTALITY RATES? We don't lock down our states because of a rash of vehicle accidents. We don't tell people not to celebrate holidays because of drug overdoses. We don't shut down businesses that sell smoking products. Yet cars, drugs, and smoking related deaths kill hundreds more every day and we accept those risks. Wake up. The election was a fraud perpetrated by swamp dwellers. You can't trust the government.  Wake up!"
Neutral,@atruetrumpster,"We already tried a lock down and how did it work? They told us to close our business. While they went to hair salons They told us not to travel. While their families vacation in other states. They told us to close restaurants and not dine in. While they had dinners at restaurant in other states. They tell us to cancel Thanksgiving. While the day before the dance in the streets with thousands. They closed our church's because of gatherings They gather and march to protest. This in no longer about your safety. This is a attempt to control you, and its working. The best way to take control over a people and control them utterly is to take a little of their freedom at a time, to erode rights by a thousand tiny and almost imperceptible reductions. In this way, the people will not see those rights and freedoms being removed until past the point at which these changes cannot be reversed...  Echo..echo..echo.."
