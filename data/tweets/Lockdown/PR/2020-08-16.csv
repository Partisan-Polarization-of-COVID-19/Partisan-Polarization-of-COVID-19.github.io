I called the number, was put on hold, & then eventually forwarded to voicemail. This is the dangerous slope we’ve been talking about - & it’s exactly what the Cabal wants. They don’t even have to mandate laws or draft legislation when landlords, banks, businesses, etc. will go along with the agenda & require this out of their tenants /customers. And what happens if 1 child tests positive in a public school setting? Will they lockdown that entire school until every kid is forcefully tested then shipped to a “quarantine facility” if positive? This is called tyranny & it never ends up well for us citizens. It’s time to wake up & fight for our God-given rights. #WWG1WGA"

Face mask do not work and staying at home will only lead to depression! The New World Order has started and we can't let them win. The Vaccine will be their ultimate goal to control you. Resist and fight. Humanity is at stake."
Neutral,@Barbiergiselle,"We need to come together to march against injustice by WHO and the pharmaceutical cartel trying to make themselves rich at the expense of the virus. The virus can easily be treated, but WHO is preventing simple methods. We need to reopen the economy . Let's come together as a world to end this injustice. I know the virus can be deadly, but it does not justify lockdowns. There is more governments are hiding. Let's stop this madness and let's bring our governments to justice, the WHO and the UN"
