Neutral,@Cbrown290175534591,"Sorry I think I downloaded this YouTube video twice but please try and watch this. Basically, we shouldn’t bother testing anyone- unless they have symptoms. the test isn’t definitive and not the ideal test for this. Mask are useless! And in some cases, killing people!!!!!

I can’t take another minute breathing in my own carbon dioxide. It is driving me insane."
