Positive,@Dddo75,"So, tRump supporters believe there was voter fraud, even though there's no fucking proof....but they don't believe masks save lives, even though there's a shit ton of proof. What the fuck am I missing here?"
Positive,@Atheistic1,"""I'm #prolife but I refuse to wear a mask or curtail my in-person socializing."" More #Christian #hypocrisy."
Neutral,@931Soldier,Self-explanatory. Now get out there and rally. Make sure to leave those masks at home. Spread the word #Maga freaks and spread that virus #covid. Let's thin the herd and truly make Amerikkka great. How great it will be with less of you in it.
