Positive,@Bigmossball,"Corona only kills 1%. Yea 1% of the US population is 3million people which significantly impacts everything including the economy for reference, there are 328.2 million people in the US. The damage it does internally to the people who don’t die is something you might not have to go through but it’s your responsibility to make things better for your country. If we don’t get it under control, more than 3million will die. So far, there have been 154 thousand deaths in the US. That’s more people than was necessary. We have more deaths than anywhere else in the world and you won’t wear a mask for what? Bc it’s a little uncomfortable? My mom’s friend has one of the worst immune systems and cases of asthma you will ever see In your entire life and she still wears a mask. A very small percentage of people who have childhood trauma relating to suffocation cannot wear masks but guess what? They’re wearing face shields to do their part. Do your fucking part. #coronavirus"

Neutral,@Ddsquad127,We aren't trying to prevent ourselves from getting it the point of wearing masks is to protect others if we may have the virus 😑
Neutral,@AnnaBortion421,"Dear people who wear their mask over their mouth but not their nose, wtf are you even doing. That's like cutting the tip off a condom and thinking it's still safe."

Neutral,@Doctorwithwound,"Here is some basic information on risk analysis: when we consider risk we make a decision on hazard x probability and then stratify the risk profile. For example hazard = COVID-19 infection and probability of infection in a shop= 0.5 ( a high estimate) then the risk is high. We then determine our risk mitigation strategies. 0% risk = not going to the shops. 100% risk = unprotected social contact with a Covid-19 infected person.Therefore Mitigation of intermediate risk = mask wearing, social distancing etc etc. Simples."
