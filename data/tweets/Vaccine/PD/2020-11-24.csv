Neutral,@BobbySharps,Effectiveness Of Masks Questioned With New Study Showing High Death Rate For Stormtroopers | The Babylon Bee
Neutral,@Djdonmega,"My complex sent an email, requiring face masks to be worn in all buildings and outside. Ok, I remember the lease I signed and there was NO mention of facemasks. As for wearing them in their buildings, I’m cool with that. As for wearing them outside, it will be a COLD DAY IN ARIZONA before I do! I wear one at work and I am glad too, because the state mandates it and the person who signs the front of my checks does as well. Don’t try pushing up on my personal freedoms because the result is not pretty."
