Positive,@GayAssWitch,"You complain about having to wear a mask for five minuets while a doctor signs the twentieth death note.  You complain about wearing a mask while a illegal immigrant is bent over picking food for you to eat, barely making minimum wage.  You complain about not being able to get your hair done while while another black boy dies in hands of a cop.    “My body my choice” until a eleven year gets raped.   “Illegal immigrants need to leave” but when they leave your the one working in the fields.  Sweetie your white privilege is showing! #trump2020 #trump #illegalimmigrants #immigrants #whiteprivilege #makeamericagreatagain #donaldtrump"
