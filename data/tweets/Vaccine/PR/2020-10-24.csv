Negative,@FreeEarthlings,"Dr. #ReinerFuellmich on #PCRtestScandal  The #Covid19Crisis must be renamed a #CoronaScandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages. How dangerous is the virus? What is the significance of a positive #PCRtest? What is the collateral damage with respect to #health and #economy? An international network of lawyers will argue the biggest #TortCase ever - the #CoronaFraudScandal - which has unfolded into probably the greatest #CrimesAgainstHumanity ever committed. #Scientists and #lawyers recognise that as a result of the deliberate panic-mongering and the corona measures enabled by this panic, #democracy is in great danger of being replaced by #FascistTotalitarian models. To make sure that no one will ever again be in a position of such power as to be able to defraud humanity, or to attempt to manipulate us with their corrupt agendas. #SaveTheEconomy #DefendHumanity #EndLockdowns  #MakeLawLawfulAgain  #GetOffOurRights"
Negative,@Jimbo510,COVID 19 HAS SAVED LIVES  I Said this 6 months ago...  The normal daily death rate in üá∫üá∏ before #covid19hoax was 7700 Deaths 7700x30days x 7 months = 1.6 million normal deaths before #covidhoax Since we know they (Deep State) have been counting all deaths Covid deaths  Why are people freaking out about 200K deaths?  Why are we still on Lockdown? #ReOpenAmerica #DrainTheSwamp #Kaga2020 @AmericanQTpie @Chiefsson @Cobrarick98 @US13s @EndHumanTrafficking2020 @Name Hidden @Cherokeeowl @Gipperguy @Puppetics2018 @HealSuffering @IsaacQAnon @usrbo @Pinkk9lover @lucki @Sezz @Leangelmuse @tfurlipa @CarolYoung2795 @theconservativetsunami   @harlangarrett  @dobelover45  @b00m3rs00n3r1  @cosmicwildchild  @usaingodwetrust  @motay  @leannedini  @mamabear44  @swgarealtor  @neutronstar  @chaysbrain  @hipchristianchick  @qbabyaus  @lukaszsuprun  @marcpowerland  @clintsprague  @christianne  @seanbos  @soulofapatriot  @daniellewv
Neutral,@hairgoddess1,"For those who want to wear a mask, by all means do so. For those who don't want to wear a mask. That's your choice. Stop shaming each other. We all have a free will and choice. Unfortunately, I have to wear one sometimes because the state and city I live in are being douchebags about it. They're sending board of cosmetology inspectors out to check on us. After being in quarantine for over a month and not qualifying for a forgivable ppp loan, I'm forced into an unforgiving situation. I stand with all my fellow Patriots in believing the swamp wants to control us."

Neutral,@Gebhardjb9,"The virus is raging in Europe right now. I heard they are going to go with the dumb fuck lock downs again... smfh. That's right, destroy yourselves over a virus that's 99%+ survivable. What the fuck is wrong with these stupid mother fuckers and why the fuck are people going along with it? Europe is heading for disaster, and if biden gets in we will be headed down the same dumb fuck path. The stupidity is getting out of control fear is clouding people's minds. It's the media that is the enemy not the virus. Just my thoughts."

Positive,@DaveRPh,"The next time someone insists you wear a mask, ask them to provide you with one that is proven to block COVID."
Positive,@FaithFamilyFitness,"I‚Äôm not sure what the policy is in other states, but in Michigan high school football players have to wear a mask while playing. College and professional players don‚Äôt. I‚Äôd like a medical explanation for that."
Positive,@FernandoAmandiSr,"Vote for us! We‚Äôll raise your taxes, pack the Court, close churches, take your rifles, defund police, put government housing in suburbs, close schools and small businesses, issue mask mandates, eliminate private health care, lower voting age to 16, install socialism. Vote for us!"
Negative,@JamesinSouthCarolina,"Eating Out While Avoiding Covid- 1. Arrive at restaurant, fish your three month old single-use surgical mask out of car's filthy cupholder. Strap up,said mask! 2.Proceed into restaurant, opening door with same handle grabbed by 200 patrons so far today. 3.Hostess immediately sits your woke party of three. Walk past entire restaurant of unmasked people. It's ok, they're sitting. 4.Sit down. *SEATED ANTI-GERM FORCEFIELD ENGAGED!!!* 5. Safely within your anti-germ forcefield, remove mask. Browse menu while breathing recirculated Air previously inside the lungs of the 200 patrons. 8. Grab drink with your bare hand. Stand up to go to bathroom. 9. Walk past 40 unmasked restaurant patrons. Open bathroom door touched by 100 people. 10. Return to table past same 40 unmasked restaurant patrons. EAT! 13. Meal complete. Mask on. Walk past 40 unmasked patrons. No matter, they're all also wearing their magical anti-germ barriers. 14. Grab exit handle, being the 220th person of the day to touch it!"

Neutral,@Bren2018ddw,Did you read about the Ohio mom who was arrested at her Son‚Äôs football game an tased for not wearing a mask? This is crazy!!!
Neutral,@FaithFamilyFitness,"As much as I detest wearing a mask, I have noticed a few benefits: 1. I can have something in my nose and nobody notices.  2. I can have something in my teeth and nobody notices. 3. Shaving becomes much less important. 4. Throw on a hat and I‚Äôm virtually unrecognizable.  5. Lip reading is no longer possible."
Neutral,@Bigpic42,"President Trump, Melania, Hope Hicks, Kelly Ann Conway, Rona McDanial, Bill Stephan, Senator Tillis and Senator Mike Lee two members of the Judiciary Committee; this isn‚Äôt about masks and it‚Äôs not a coincidence. MSNBC already talking to Pelosi about taking over if Pence gets sick. Dems and their donors are slime."
Neutral,@Donmon777,This is not what we need as Vice President. Harris screams at Trump about KKK. And BLM is a demonic spirit in black masks wanting violence and take over. Their religion is invoking spirits of dead to take up violence in our nation.  They practice IFA. An African religion that pours blood on streets. Look it up. It‚Äôs true witchcraft. That kind of evil we can‚Äôt have in the White House
Neutral,@deconservatievehuisvrouw,"I went to a Jumbo supermarket in another city (Almere) yesterday. They had a whole list of coronavirus rules: shop alone, stay 1.5 metres away from others, face diaper not mandatory but advised. üòÇHusband and I went together, didn't keep distance, pressed that sheep sound button every time I saw someone wearing a mask, didn't follow the arrows on the floor. I saw the staff and visitors looking at me. I kept staring back at them like a monkey ready to fight. No one messes with an aggressive monkey in the animal kingdom. It's time for these freedom violators to know their place. #parlernl"
Neutral,@Iluvmotherhood,"I laugh at the ridiculousness of how smart the Coronavirus is. People are so gullible. Yes I think it is real & people can die. But everything else is Bull. Let me get it straight: I WILL get it if I go to church, or a bar, a Trump Rally, a funeral of a loved one, or school, or stay out past 10pm, but I WON‚ÄôT get it at a riot (protest), a plane, an amusement park, a restaurant ONCE I sit down, a funeral of someone being honored by the left, or any huge box store like Walmart.  Got it. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Give me a break. It‚Äôs a virus people. We will all probably get it. It was modified in a lab because there is no virus that has its ability of being able to thrive anywhere and in any condition and also have no rhyme or reason in which gets it, how they get it, their symptoms,, now getting it again. I am over it all. So I post this because I am mad. My daughter is exhausted every day from wearing a mask in school. One of my drs says this is a huge mistake for healthy people to wear them.  #covid"
