Positive,@BalloonGuyz,"Ok there's two slogans out there. One . Stay Loud! Stay Proud! Persist! and Resist!  The second is. Stay Home. Stay Calm . Stay Active. The first one is for B. L. M. L. G. B. T. And A.N.T.I.F.A. This means get up get out and be as loud and cause as much un-rest as we can, till we get what we demand!  The second is the Silent working majority. Stay Home , Shut Up, and DO AS WE SAY. I'm so glad I don't have children or grand children, to have to conform to the leftists point of view . Some day you will look at your children and or grand children and explain the reason they are not Free like you used to be. And your answer should be the truth. We the people let the Democratic party take over our country because we wouldn't GET UP GET OUT AND TAKE ON THIS OVER TAKE OF OUR COUNTRY! I'm so sorry you have to suffer like this üíî because of my/ our lack of STANDING UP LIKE GODS PEOPLE ARE TOLD TO DO! now we have lost our freedom and our country. Think about that ."

No mail in voting, if you can't have in person voting then delay it till you can. Loser's will never win unless they cheat."

Neutral,@JCBueno,"To hell with masks. When they say that I need a mask to go into whatever building I‚Äôm going in, I tell em, ‚Äú It‚Äôs against my right‚Äù or ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wear masks‚Äù and my polite yet firm and determined mindset energy keeps people aware that I‚Äôm not one to push a silly mandate on. This goes for my 13 year old boy, my 11 year old daughter and my RN wife. We the people will fight injustice every day, this is how we begin to take our power back and by submitting to their ill-found pseudoscience control mandates we lose our power. Amen"
Neutral,@ejrwheeler,"I am seeing this nationwide. Store clerks, previously having ZERO authority over anything within the store, being the self-appointed mask gestapo. I am medical exemption for masks, don‚Äôt, can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt wear them for anyone. ADA says I only must disclose that I am mask exempt for medical reasons. HIPPA says that ‚Äúthey‚Äù have no business or right to see any documentation as to why. I was at a Pilot Travel Center in Eagle Pass, TX at my company mandated fuel stop. The clerk shouted at me saying I wasn‚Äôt allowed in the store and pointing at the sign on the door... mind you, I have been at a Flying J (same company) all week with NO issues! Was forced to pay at the pump despite the inherent security issues with that, and was not allowed the restroom. First stop after that... haven‚Äôt found it yet! I drove an hour and a half and had to stop on a wide shoulder for the night. Good thing I am a guy and the world‚Äôs my toilet!"

Neutral,@DigitalSwolljer,ü§£ yeah right! WTF is a ‚Äúcivil citation‚Äù? There‚Äôs not even a snowball chance in hell that I would sign for this & I would love to have idiots like this try to arrest me for not wearing a mask. Try it. #ImJustSayin
