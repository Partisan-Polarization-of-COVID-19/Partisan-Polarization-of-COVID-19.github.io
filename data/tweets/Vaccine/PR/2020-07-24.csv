Negative,@JimJordan,"Things the Democrats want: -Open borders & closed churches -Open borders & closed schools -Open borders & closed businesses -Open borders & closed gun shops -Open borders & closed stadiums How about instead of reopening the border, we reopen America?"
Positive,@DTrump2020,This is the last election you may actually have a choice if Republicans do not gain a huge win you can kiss your freedoms goodbye. Do not stay home. Go and vote.
Positive,@Antipolean,"What has #feminism given #women ? ☑️ Too #poor to have large #families. ☑️ When we DO have #children, we're too poor to stay at home, so we now entrust them to the state via #childcare, #kindergartens, #stateruneducation.  ☑️ House prices have skyrocketed in many countries. Thanks to #twoincomes being the norm, housing is now #lessaffordable than ever. ☑️ Most of us #work full time, often for low wages. No time for partners, children, friends, #community, #volunteering, personal hobbies. We're legions of #exhaustedwomen.  ☑️ We don't have the time or energy to cook, so we're fatter and sicker than our grandmothers were, with a shorter #lifeexpectancy than our mothers generation. #fatandsick  ☑️ We've been duped into believing that #hookupculture will make us happy, when the truth is that women derive real #happiness from deep, long-term, secure relationships with men.  #Feminism has failed women. It's time to throw it away.  #feminismiscancer #feminismsucks #antifeminism"
Neutral,@DukeHedaya,Of course she does. I wonder how many Americans she plans on taking care of financially. Not like lockdowns affect her.  F*ck This': Alyssa Milano Demands 'National Shut Down Now'
Neutral,@BethVanDuyne,Being in lockdowns take a physical and mental toll on people and families. I know I have to get out a walk when I can and it truly helps. Let me know what you do and maybe I can join you and your family on a walk sometime!
Neutral,@Jmraikes,"I am totally aware of the fear people have regarding this Covid but I am in awe of what these democrat governors have done. Being from Washington State the lockdowns were tolerable but presently I am in Albuquerque, NM and Draconian is very understated. The people are in a total panic, face masks, store closures and social distancing is extreme and people do not understand that this is a nasty China Flu designed to attack the elderly and underlying conditions population. 20 and 30 year olds are just getting sick, not overwhelming the system.  The population is totally poorly informed on the disease, riots, protests and all the hate being spewed by the minority Marxists and Hard Left. To all of us continue to speak the truth, educate with facts, and turn at least one person a day to understand what Conservatism and Humanity is all about."
Negative,@DeeHicksExplantLiaison,"So let me get this straight. We have an enormous amount of poverty, hunger, child abuse, sex trafficking, murder, vaccine death and injury, missing children and a government and Pharmaceutical industry that becomes richer by the minute and you believe a pandemic with an incredibly low death rate is their top priority? They have destroyed lives, the economy, and are fining people that choose to not wear a mask, arrest business owners that try to make a living, manipulate people, cancel weddings, limit numbers at funerals, exclude visitors from hospitals, cause a mass genocide in nursing homes, cause a race war, intend to mandate vaccines and track people like animals and you think you’re “doing your part” by wearing a mask and social distancing?

Positive,@Cangekeys,Every time I have to wear a mask I think to myself .... what the hell has happened to the America I grew up in? When did we all become so complacent? We look like a bunch of far eastern tourists who put up ✌️every time they take a photo. I only hope our country does not follow in their footsteps! Wake up America!

Neutral,@BritishTom,I won’t be wearing a mask!

Neutral,@BroSteve22,I just checked this number and it is real.  Report illegal face mask abuse by your governor!
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,The masks don’t work. You’re just suffocating yourselves & giving in to tyranny. Take them off.
Neutral,@Hollybryant819,"Yet, the fear-mongered mask wearers will still scream that we should still wear them."
Neutral,@FlyoverVet,You have to have an IQ of 70 to believe a cloth mask will stop a 120 nanometer diameter virus.
Neutral,@Cherokeeowl,"Watch Antoine Tucker, running in NY14 against AOC, tell you about masks & the virus.  I would vote for this guy!"
Neutral,@JFerreira67,If it were flu season and we tested 10% of the population what do you think the result would be?  It's bullshit people.  Who gives you the authority to reduce my oxygen with a mask?
Neutral,@Gjgigi,Great! now can you remove the mask mandate so we can get back to normal around here?  So sick of the lies and BS.
Neutral,@FormerLib,Thinking about making masks that say #alllivesmatter and #backtheblue. I bet suddenly #fauci would say we don’t need them anymore 😂😂.
Neutral,@darrengrimes,What does my sexuality have to do with disliking the idea of state-enforced mask wearing? And why is this ‘news’ – talk about desperation for clicks! Horrible little identity-politics obsessed cesspit of despair.
Neutral,@Cherokeeowl,"The idiots who are Rioting, looting, destroying, & demanding masks are the smallest % of the population with the loudest voices.  Why do we put up with this behavior???  We need to push back - Resist!  I’m tired of it!  #gijoevets"
Neutral,@Jonny_667,From July 24th you must wear a face mask in all shops because over the last 4 months all shop workers have contracted COVID?? Echo if you don’t know what the fxuk is going on anymore 🙄
Neutral,@JimJordan,"Drew Brees - asks that people respect the flag - CANCELED Mike Gundy - wears the “wrong” t-shirt fishing - CANCELED  James Harden - wears a #BackTheBlue mask - CANCELED  If the mob wins, we all lose."
Neutral,@Fightingatorfan,"If you are a peaceful protester. Why do you need a gas mask, baseball bat, or a strategically placed pallet of bricks? These are the questions the peaceful protesters need to be asking each other before they go into the streets to be used as pawns and have their cause high jacked by outsiders."
Neutral,@ImaLibbyTarian,"Even scarier how many buy into the flu vaccine myth The flu shot is only 60% effective in a good year. Most years it is only 35 to 40% effective. Where I come from, that is a failing grade Moreover, all viruses replicate the same way, so a COVID vaccine will be a crap shot also. Herd immunity is our best chance of success.  So stop whinning about masks and the need to shut down again until we have a vaccine and thank those of us willing to live our lives and deal with it if we get COVID."

Neutral,@AuthorRyanC,"Back on January 4th of this year, I wrote a blog post warning about implantable microchip technology & the mark of the beast. It ended up being a very timely post. Then on April 19th I wrote a 2nd part to that warning regarding Coronavirus, vaccines, and microchips. If you would like to know more about Revelation, the end times, and what is really going on in this crazy world, please read my post below. A link to part 1 is in it, so you can read both if you like. The times are at hand and they are happening in our time! Please heed the warning! Fight the NWO and never submit to their evil! Come to Jesus, He loves you! God bless you all!"
