Negative,@CraigTheTechTeacher,"‚ÄúEvery single day we wake up and make decisions. Each and every decision carries a level of risk with it. From driving to work, eating an unhealthy breakfast, or deciding to exercise or not. These decisions impact our lives in negative or positive ways. When you boil it down, every single decision carries a statistical chance of killing us or others. Many people are not used to looking at their lives through this lens, and it‚Äôs why many struggle with reconciling the risk related to COVID-19 in their daily lives.‚Äù #COVID-19 #MSM #FakeNews #Risk #ReopenAmerica #Election2020"

Positive,@carpedonktum,"No matter what happens on Tuesday, I want to thank President Trump and all of you for providing me with all of the amazing opportunities and experiences over the last 4 years. I never could have dreamed that a stay at home dad from Kansas, making videos in his spare time could be so blessed as I have. From being invited to the White House, to traveling around the country, and being elevated to a position where I could reach 273,000 people on Twitter, 231,000 people on Parler, 54,000 people on youtube, 51,000 people on Facebook, and 38,000 people on Instagram. Thank you and I love you all. I am the luckiest guy in history."
