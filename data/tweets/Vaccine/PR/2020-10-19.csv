Negative,@Audax1954,"The coronavirus is back in force. Many nations around the world are seeing alarming rises in cases and deaths, totals that in many instances exceed the highs reached in March, April, and May. From the beginning of the pandemic, governments around the world have tried to tame the virus. All have failed, to varying degrees. Whether governments implement draconian lockdowns, modest lockdowns, or no lockdowns at all, the virus has spread. Some countries with harsh lockdowns have fared better; many have fared worse. As some have pointed out, the virus doesnâ€™t seem to care what policies you put in place."
Neutral,@andweknow,10.2.20: TEN days of DARKNESS/Quarantine? RED OCTOBER! Watch here:
Neutral,@buskirk,Here is Fauci confirming that transmission of respiratory viruses by asymptomatic viruses is very rare and is NEVER the driver of outbreaks. So why are public health authorities issuing guidance to treat asymptomatic people as if they are major vectors of viral transmission? That is one of the premises of lockdowns and quarantines.
Neutral,@CarolLyne,"MPs need to be reminded of their legal duty or they will be held to account and could be charged with Malfeasance (wrongdoing or misconduct especially by a public official) resulting in a 10 year prison sentence. Unbalanced Valence, Half-whit Whitty, Bully-boy Boris, Hand on Cock-sorry- Mr Hancock should be arrested for causing more deaths due to the unlawful lockdowns. #plandemic #parler #politics"
Neutral,@11phenomenon,Weird how states big into lockdowns have done nothing about homeless packed into shelters like sardines coming and going infecting others. Everyday a super spreader while others are ironically moved closer to homelessness due to job killing restrictions. And yet the masses are forced to wear unhealthy masks while the homeless super spreader problem and demonstrations/riot super spreaders are ignored.
Negative,@donneal,"Take the stupid, useless masks off, and get back to normal living! If masks worked, you wouldnâ€™t need social distancing; if social distancing worked, you wouldnâ€™t need masks. Quit being played! Take back your life! Itâ€™s not the virus, itâ€™s the fear promulgated by Fauci and the mainstream media."

Neutral,@Audax1954,"Meanwhile, Americaâ€™s favorite little tyrant is out there letting you know that youâ€™ll need to wear masks and socially distance even after a vaccine that is 95% effective. Think about the numbers involved in that. COVID is still 99.4% survivable, and truly only represents an out-sized danger to those above 75 years of age. Under that age range, you are talking about death rates that either mirror the flu or are less than the flu as you get into children. While a flu vaccine is typically only 40% effective, new vaccines for COVID have shown effectiveness rates of 95%. That means that once the vaccine is deployed, COVID will be far less of a problem than the regular flu. Yet, Fauci still wants you to wear ineffective masks and socially distance for years afterward. For what? Is the goal for no one to ever die again or to manage the disease in a responsible manner?"
Neutral,@1776stonewall,"An Oregon doctor, Dr. Steven LaTulippe, has his medical license revoked simply for questioning the effectiveness of face masks and for comparing Covid-19 to the common cold. . . and most importantly - for attending a Pro-Trump ""Stop The Steal"" rally. The Oregon Medical Board issued an emergency suspension to revoke his license. . At the Stop the steal rally Dr. LaTulippe said ""I want you to know that I never shut down during the entire COVID season, from the time it was declared till now. I hate to tell you this, it might scare you, but I and my staff, none of us once wore a mask in my clinic. And how many problems did we have in our clinic from that? Zero! Absolutely none."". . . This is what the left does, folks. If you go against the narrative they destroy your career. Remember that Canadian professor who proved that the polar bears in the arctic were thriving? That there was actually over 40,000 of them there? She was fired for that, because it disproved a huge global warming lie"

Neutral,@DrGosar,Clothing is optional. Masks are not.

Neutral,@ConnieHair,This got zero press coverage. Too bad. It should have. The American Association of Physicians and Surgeons report on masks. Hint: they don't work for Wuhan China Virus.

Neutral,@AmericaFirst1,And it has every right to. All youâ€™ve got to do is watch where Bill Gates is talking about reducing the world population by 10-15 % and in the same conversation talking about their vaccines ðŸ’‰ Yeah thatâ€™ll be the day.
