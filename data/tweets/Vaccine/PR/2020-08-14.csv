Negative,@JimJordan,"Things the Democrats want: -Open borders & closed churches -Open borders & closed schools -Open borders & closed businesses -Open borders & closed gun shops -Open borders & closed stadiums How about instead of reopening the border, we reopen America?"
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"An apartment complex in Ventura County, CA is locking their residents inside the building until all of them are tested for Covid. I called the number, was put on hold, & then eventually forwarded to voicemail. This is the dangerous slope we’ve been talking about - & it’s exactly what the Cabal wants. They don’t even have to mandate laws or draft legislation when landlords, banks, businesses, etc. will go along with the agenda & require this out of their tenants /customers. And what happens if 1 child tests positive in a public school setting? Will they lockdown that entire school until every kid is forcefully tested then shipped to a “quarantine facility” if positive? This is called tyranny & it never ends up well for us citizens. It’s time to wake up & fight for our God-given rights. #WWG1WGA"

Neutral,@7SDG,"This is important. We didn’t need the lockdowns . We didn’t need the turmoil, lost jobs, or other emerging health issues. We had the solution all along. Fauci and the media did a number on this country."
Positive,@Huneycuttbear13,Yes I carry every where all the time and no i don't wear a mask!
Negative,@AgendaofLight,I feel grateful and hopeful with the passing days as I meet more brave hearted patriots willing to stand up against the mob. We are in this together so we must come together.

Negative,@johnnypatriot1,"TRUMP CALLS MASKLESS FRIENDS PEACEFUL PROTESTERS AT GOLF CLUB PRESSER ,MEDIA LOSES IT . if you watched the presidents presser last night ' then you saw what i call perhaps one of trumps greatest troll hits on the media of all time ,he literally shoveled their own shit right back in their face .ofcourse you know how the media is utterly obsessed with masks ,so ofcourse a reporter just had to ask why trumps friends didn't have masks on ,trump says they are peaceful protesters ,the crowd exploded in applause and laughter ,but naturally the media and the left was completely triggered . it was a beautiful thing to behold . Then he ended the presser by calling out the corrupt fake news ,another pay per view moment .he has mastered the art of triggering the left and the fake news media ,and i for one love it ."
Neutral,@Gbalrt,"Months ago, I hated Trump and the right. They were the racist party. I wanted to wear my mask and protest BLM. I supported black lives matter, and I gained more knowledge on my white privileged and systematic racism, and how our system kept POC down. I kept researching, kept reading stories, kept having conversations. My research went so deep, my conversations were so detailed, it lead me down so many paths. I began to unravel the lies of the mainstream media. I began to learn how Trump has helped the black community, creating the lowest unemployment rates for not only them, but everyone. I learned about the funding he put into black communities. I learned that the Democratic Party, the essence of my being, created “systematic racism”, as well as uses buzz words to create a narrative. I learned that being forced to wear masks goes against our constitutional rights. I learned that CENSORSHIP IS THE FIRST STEP to destroying democracy. Democrats are destroying America. I walked away."
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,Big thank you to whoever made this visual. And let’s not forget the holes are even bigger on the cloth masks....
Neutral,@bwillis,"Fuhrer Whitmer doubled down on the masks. My employees can no longer assume a medical condition, and I now have to force them to confront customers. I'm moving to Florida"

Neutral,@Gmac1,ESTABLISHMENT  That’s who controls us. And get over Covid19 my little sheep. Don’t comply with wearing masks. No wonder why there’s a tampon shortage in America. Too many pussies that can’t stand up for their rights!
Neutral,@AlexschramTN,"Just finished EARLY VOTING in Williamson County this afternoon! Make sure you GO VOTE, either early through Aug 1 or on election day (Aug 6th). Even got to sport my American flag mask! Glad to support so many great TNGOP candidates!"
Neutral,@DeltaJulietTango,"Huge vaccine, vaccine, vaccine push today by Trump & wear your masks push.  Fucking scam. Everyone is being played. Voluntary will mean no travel, no benifits, and slowly add more and more until they get the non vaccinated to conform.  Its all about technology advancement, controlling & brainwashing the public to accept while keeping fallout to a minimum. The west will not fall behind on technology. Think about it. The rest of the world advances and the USA stays behind for “freedoms” while China and others surge way ahead. Not gonna happen.  All the information they have collected on us & billions of dollars doing so will not go to waste.  That’s the plan. EVERYTHING is a distraction. EVERYTHING.  We are all f**ked & majority of sheep will f**king embraces it."

Neutral,@DigiDiva2020,Covid vaccine. Please Listen to this Physician share the dangers of the Covid Vaccine that is coming.. A Must Watch! #Parler #WWG1WGA #Covid19 #MAGA #TheGreatAwakening #Vaccines
Neutral,@Bjshaven,Ask Bill Gates why he will not have his kids and family get any vaccines. He knows what is in them and he knows they are dangerous or deadly. WAKE UP PEOPLE AND STOP BEING CONTROLLED.
Neutral,@derekrosenstein,It's all about #transhumanism. Once you're no longer human you're no longer protected by the Constitution. You're no longer redeemable by God also. Does anyone else see the big picture? #vaccines This was removed by Twitter.
