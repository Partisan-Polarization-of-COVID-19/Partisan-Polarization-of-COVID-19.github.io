Negative,@dianedueck,"Of course they had to make masks essential and normal so that they can't mandate no masks for rioters,protesters,and Antifa."
Negative,@Derek,Dr. Fauci was caught by Americas Voice News for taking his mask off when the hearing was over. You can’t make this up.

Neutral,@gaypatriot,It's just a mask? It's just two weeks. It's just non-essential businesses. It's just to keep from overwhelming the hospitals. It's just until cases go down more. It's just to keep others from being scared. It's just for a few more weeks. It's just until we get a vaccine. It's just a few side effects. It's just to let people know you're safe to be around. It's just for the coronavirus vaccine. It's just a few more months. It’s just a video. It’s just an email account. It's just for protecting others from hate speech. It's just a few people. It's just a credit card company.  It's just a little chip. It’s just for medical information and paying for things. It’s just so you can travel. It’s just so you can get your driver’s license. It’s just so you can vote. It's just for a few more years. It's just a statue. It's just a building. It's just a song. It’s just a piece of paper. It's just a flag. It's just a piece of cloth. It's not just a piece of cloth. It's not just a mask.
Neutral,@Gtarecking,The Mask President Trump wore at Walter Reed Hospital will be a Highlight at his Library when HE leaves office in 2025 or Later!!!
Neutral,@ConservativeCher,Something is up with Gov Abbott . I am surprised he is “ masking “ us up again ! It is not healthy and is not helping our state of minds.  The death rates are down dramatically yet all they report is how many people tested positive today - 3000 people tested positive and there were 9 deaths . Something close to that !!
Neutral,@ghedger,Great news if true: Florida well on its way to herd immunity for novel coronavirus:
