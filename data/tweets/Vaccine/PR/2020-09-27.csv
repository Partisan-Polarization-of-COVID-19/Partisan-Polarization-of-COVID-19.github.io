Neutral,@Gmadeira,"In not so many words, they want to control the people, the mask mandate is a farce, wearing a mask is detrimental to our health."

Neutral,@Eam0132,"Be like Florida... Breaking News  Florida removes statewide capacity restrictions on restaurants and other businesses; can now operate at 100%; order also prohibits fines for mask requirements, according to Orlando Sentinel"
Neutral,@CrunchyGrace9,"Getting to stand at the altar of our OPEN church today, hands raised worshiping with my brothers and sisters in Christ made me so thankful but so aware that there are so many that are not out of fear. This is not ok. Wake up. Warrior up y‚Äôall. This is a spiritual battle. FIGHT.  I will respect your right to wear your mask and walk around in fear so long as you respect my right not to.  #livefreeordie #plandemic2020 #yourebeingplayed  #myrightdoesntendwhereyourfearbegins"
Neutral,@falseflvg,"The CDC quietly admits that only 6% of Covid-19 deaths were strictly due to Covid. That‚Äôs fewer than 10,000 deaths.  Meanwhile businesses have been financially destroyed. States are hiding behind fake science to keep their states locked up. Masks are still being mandated. Some states claim they won‚Äôt return to normal until there‚Äôs a vaccine.  It‚Äôs time to OPEN UP! #cdc #covid19 #covid #science #conservative #parlee #unlockmichigan #tyranny #michigan #usmc #MarineCorps #resist #2a"

Neutral,@Ccac15,"In a stunning development, a former Chief Science Officer for the pharmaceutical giant Pfizer says ""there is no science to suggest a second wave should happen."" The ""Big Pharma"" insider asserts that false positive results from inherently unreliable COVID tests are being used to manufacture a ""second wave"" based on ""new cases."" Dr. Mike Yeadon, a former Vice President and Chief Science Officer for Pfizer for 16 years, says that half or even ""almost all"" of tests for COVID are false positives. Dr. Yeadon also argues that the threshold for herd immunity may be much lower than previously thought, and may have been reached in many countries already."
Neutral,@Albotros,"#covid19 #herdimmunity  James Todaro, MD (@JamesTodaroMD) Tweeted: More immunologists, statisticians & epidemiologists observe that ~20% infected (based on serology) might be the actual herd immunity threshold for COVID-19. Evidence continues to show T-cells instead of antibodies are the reason."
