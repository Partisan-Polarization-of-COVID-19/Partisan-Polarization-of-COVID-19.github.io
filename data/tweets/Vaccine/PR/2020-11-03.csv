Positive,@carpedonktum,"No matter what happens on Tuesday, I want to thank President Trump and all of you for providing me with all of the amazing opportunities and experiences over the last 4 years. I never could have dreamed that a stay at home dad from Kansas, making videos in his spare time could be so blessed as I have. From being invited to the White House, to traveling around the country, and being elevated to a position where I could reach 273,000 people on Twitter, 231,000 people on Parler, 54,000 people on youtube, 51,000 people on Facebook, and 38,000 people on Instagram. Thank you and I love you all. I am the luckiest guy in history."

Neutral,@Inkabinkabonk,Lockdowns Place Religious Freedom Under Assault
Neutral,@JimJordan,Republicans:  Liberty. Not lockdowns.  Freedom. Not socialism.  Opportunity. Not mandates.
Neutral,@Cito1952,Trump: Joe Biden Will Turn America into a ‘Prison State’ with Coronavirus Lockdowns
Neutral,@DiamondAndSilk,Governors do not have the right to take away freedoms by choosing lockdowns for Americans instead of allowing Americans to make their own choice with therapeutic medicines or a vaccine!
Neutral,@16000dv,"Ingraham: Americans will be 'stripped of any freedom' under Biden presidency, coronavirus lockdowns | Fox News Ain’t Democratic Socialism Great? We are at War. Take no Prisoners. VOTE RED IN PERSON."
Neutral,@Jfmancuso27,Why are we talking about stimulus to the American People? The only stimulus should go to those unemployed or negatively impacted by Covid and the shutdowns.
Negative,@BobRedwine,And I really did. In person. No mask.
Negative,@ImDeplorable16,"Judicial Watch Sues for Unmasking Records: Biden, Top Obama Officials ‘Unmasked’ General Flynn | Judicial Watch"
Negative,@Colbaltbl,I’m not sure who painted this... but thank you... it’s one of the most powerful pictures of the division in our country... Lord protect our President... give him your wisdom to do what’s right for our nation... watch over his cabinet... and unmask the evil that lurks trying to destroy the US from within....
Neutral,@darrengrimes,"Clocked a guy wearing a Biden/Harris face mask tonight, good for him. I’m sure he’s able to walk around London without an issue, I’m not sure the same would be true were it to be a Trump/Pence face mask. Really made me think about modern society’s lack of political tolerance."
Neutral,@Imeanbusiness2015,The Stand  Masks from a movie
Neutral,@JessektheLeoViking,I love the look on sleepy Joes corrupt face! Shocked how dare you call me out. Not many mask in that crowd!😂😂😂 This guy is a champion! Way to stand up to the communist mob!🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Neutral,@Iluvmotherhood,"I laugh at the ridiculousness of how smart the Coronavirus is. People are so gullible. Yes I think it is real & people can die. But everything else is Bull. Let me get it straight: I WILL get it if I go to church, or a bar, a Trump Rally, a funeral of a loved one, or school, or stay out past 10pm, but I WON’T get it at a riot (protest), a plane, an amusement park, a restaurant ONCE I sit down, a funeral of someone being honored by the left, or any huge box store like Walmart.  Got it. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Give me a break. It’s a virus people. We will all probably get it. It was modified in a lab because there is no virus that has its ability of being able to thrive anywhere and in any condition and also have no rhyme or reason in which gets it, how they get it, their symptoms,, now getting it again. I am over it all. So I post this because I am mad. My daughter is exhausted every day from wearing a mask in school. One of my drs says this is a huge mistake for healthy people to wear them.  #covid"
Positive,@ArchAngelRaphael,Natural immunity. If you catch it... beat it. Soon it will be in the past. Getting vaccinated is not necessary but it's being dominated...
Neutral,@Barber4liberty,"This!!! I have done my best to respect the diverse opinions regarding COVID-19 over these past few months, however the ER nurse that posted this brilliantly sums up my train of thought. Please just take politics out of it and read this with an open mind using common sense. Is there anyone out there who can tell me what our end game is with the Covid-19? What is the magic formula that is going to allow us to sound the ""all clear""? Is it zero cases? The only way that will happen is if we just stop testing and stop reporting. Is it a vaccine? It took 25 years for a chicken pox vaccine to be developed. The smallpox inoculation was discovered in 1796 the last known natural case was in 1977. We have a flu vaccine that is only 40 to 60% effective and less than half of the US population choose to get one, and roughly 20,000 Americans will die of the flu or flu complications. Oh, you'll mandate it, like other vaccines are mandated in order to attend school, travel to some foreign countries, etc"
Neutral,@Bonnieandskeeter,Christiane Northrup (@DrChrisNorthrup) Tweeted: Forced Vaccines & Digital IDs via @YouTube  Please look at this warning about wuflu vaccine.
Neutral,@DMAusa,NOBODY is getting rid of the stupid virus. Do people really believe politicians can do a damn thing at this point except wait for treatments and vaccines?
Neutral,@DiamondAndSilk,Diamond and Silk have a question. Did Pfizer take almost 2 Billion dollars of American tax dollars to make 100 Million doses of vaccines by the end of the year but now they can only deliver 25 Million doses and they plan to send half of those doses overseas? Did Americans get $h!tted by Pfizer?
