Positive,@HopeSprings,"Governor Kristi Noem (R-SD) has been the only Governor in America that has gotten it right. Not only has she left wearing a mask up to the individual, she never shut her state down, or even the buinesses in her state. She even stands at the South Dakota State Captiol, everyday, no matter the weather, and prays over her state, and then walks the halls of the South Dakota state capitol and prays over every legislator's office, and elected official, that God will guide them and help them make the right desicions. South Dakota is in the best shape and condition than any other state in our nation. Governor Noem is a true constitutionalist! She is an example and an inspiration to us all! Copied. Cause it should be said, known and shared all across this country that Gov. Noem is exactly the kind of leader every politician should strive to be!!"
Neutral,@JakeStelmach,"Why donâ€™t we all go to our local stores at least once without a mask and see what happens (unless youâ€™re actually sick, then wear one). I did today in California and was not admonished by anyone. #nomaskchallenege"
Neutral,@Clinton614,"USA USA USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ The amount of support we had was overwhelming. First time I've felt normal in months. Nobody had on a mask, just about everyone was armed, hundreds of cars driving by honking, waving and showing their support.... This is how you counter a BLM protest and shut them down! #clinton614"
