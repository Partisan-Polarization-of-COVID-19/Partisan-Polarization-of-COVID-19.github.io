Negative,@conservativecountrymedia,Is this possible? Can we do this? Has the government destroyed small business? #reopenamerica
Positive,@DessoffAltodoc,"I’m amused by those without any scientific background dismissing concepts like herd immunity. Risk is a part of life. Balancing risk is something we all used to be comfortable with. It seems some are happy relinquishing liberty and freedom for the idea that never leaving the house means no one will die. It’s far more complicated than that. Following logical guidance to stay at home makes sense in many situations but not in others. Unless herd immunity is built we will be in perpetual lockdown. I’m following the rules and enjoy exercise in the fresh air. If you can’t get out even for exercise make sure you’re getting vitamin D. Stay healthy, consider personal and communal risk and strive for Liberty."

Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"And just like that, my Twitter account I’ve been working on every day for over 3 years is now gone. And they wouldn’t even give me a reason. Must have been hitting too close to home on the vaccines. But that’s okay. Nothing can stop what is coming. And nothing will stop me from waking up & continuing to expose these Deep State demons every single day until they are gone from our existence. 🌍🙏🏻💯 #WWG1WGA #DarkToLight #TheGreatAwakening #GodWins #PatriotsAreInControl #TrustThePlan #PanicInDC #Qanon #TheStormIsUponUs #NothingCanStopWhatsComing"
