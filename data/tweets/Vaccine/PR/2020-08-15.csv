Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"An apartment complex in Ventura County, CA is locking their residents inside the building until all of them are tested for Covid. I called the number, was put on hold, & then eventually forwarded to voicemail. This is the dangerous slope we’ve been talking about - & it’s exactly what the Cabal wants. They don’t even have to mandate laws or draft legislation when landlords, banks, businesses, etc. will go along with the agenda & require this out of their tenants /customers. And what happens if 1 child tests positive in a public school setting? Will they lockdown that entire school until every kid is forcefully tested then shipped to a “quarantine facility” if positive? This is called tyranny & it never ends up well for us citizens. It’s time to wake up & fight for our God-given rights. #WWG1WGA"
Positive,@deeeezy,"Geez, I don’t understand why the heck they can’t just give us simple guidelines and let the population decide how they go about their lives. Wash your hands, wear a mask if a private business asks you to or you personally feel the need and consider the elderly. But the govt should just bugger off and get on with their jobs. It’s ridiculous to think they can control an invisible virus that poses a risk to a small subset of the population. Let the the younger generation save our economy before China gets a shot at us...."
Positive,@HopeSprings,"Governor Kristi Noem (R-SD) has been the only Governor in America that has gotten it right. Not only has she left wearing a mask up to the individual, she never shut her state down, or even the buinesses in her state. She even stands at the South Dakota State Captiol, everyday, no matter the weather, and prays over her state, and then walks the halls of the South Dakota state capitol and prays over every legislator's office, and elected official, that God will guide them and help them make the right desicions. South Dakota is in the best shape and condition than any other state in our nation. Governor Noem is a true constitutionalist! She is an example and an inspiration to us all! Copied. Cause it should be said, known and shared all across this country that Gov. Noem is exactly the kind of leader every politician should strive to be!!"
Neutral,@2FistsOfJustice,"If their ""Mask Theory"" actually worked why did they release inmates instead of just ...... Giving them all masks ?"
Neutral,@Clinton614,"I have made a list of businesses that I can shop at without a mask, they get my business (my money). If I need to go to an unfamiliar store outside of that list, I'll just walk in regardless of any mask signs. If nobody says anything to me, they will get my business (my money). If they say something and make me leave even after explaining to them the 'exemptions' in place, they get a 1 star google, yelp review and don't get any business (money) from me ever again. Fight Back People! Make sure you explain in your reviews, so the business owners can see how much business they are losing. #clinton614"
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,Big thank you to whoever made this visual. And let’s not forget the holes are even bigger on the cloth masks....
Neutral,@Jayanne82,It's another beautiful sunny day here on the Island. We don't get a lot of those so a walk along the Harbor is in the works. Without the MASK!

Neutral,@Instruct2A,"Can we pick a date? ...... Can we just pick an end date to tell them all to F off??  Done with the masks, distancing, shut downs.......ALL of it.  If the death rate was 99.8% then yes....shut it down. But if that’s the survival rate then WTF are we doing??  Virus’ have been around forever and will be here long after we’re gone. Some will die.  Give us the info and let US decide. The PEOPLE need to remember that we control THEM.....they don’t get to control US.  Pick a date cause I’m done with this shit."
Neutral,@ChadPerkinsME,"The democrats used to hind behind white hoods to hide their racist crap. Now they hide behind their black ANTIFA masks, same racist BS. Real Americans are unapologetic, unafraid to express our views, we don't hide. I saw a segment a few days ago about how many conservatives are afraid to share their views, afraid to put up a Trump sign, afraid of retaliation and stigmatization.  Really folks? You are Americans, start acting like it. The cancel culture can go pound sand. They don't have any power if you don't give it to them. What good is your First Amendment right if you refuse to exercise it, defend it? We have our own businesses, I am on the ballot. But my family will not be silenced, my kids are taught that if you don't believe it 100%, you don't really believe it. You don't have to be mean, or a jerk about your views, but you should never back down from your values. Afraid to stand up for your beliefs? Remember those that bled so you could freely believe them. Live brave."

Neutral,@DannALbenDalton,"We need to keep Trump safe from Dr Fauci! Trump needs to realize that herd immunity is a good thing, not a bad one. Someone tell him he did not save us from 2.2 million deaths. He needs to understand he has been lied to about this damn virus from the minute Fauci into his office."
