Neutral,@AgroSurAmericaSA,DISTURBING Leaked Emails Show Democrats LIED About Lockdowns! via @YouTube
Positive,@Flirtyskirt,My new response to people when they ask me why I’m not wearing a mask: “I can’t smell freedom with a mask on.” Boom. End of discussion
Negative,@donneal,"Take the stupid, useless masks off, and get back to normal living! If masks worked, you wouldn’t need social distancing; if social distancing worked, you wouldn’t need masks. Quit being played! Take back your life! It’s not the virus, it’s the fear promulgated by Fauci and the mainstream media."
Negative,@ConservativeCat,No masks
Neutral,@David52,Bidens plan is we should wear masks all the time. Is that the scientific answer?
Neutral,@JeanetteLeece,"NOW, under threat of lawsuit, the CDC says MASKS DO NOTHING?!"
Neutral,@fogcitymidge,What’s really going on with the mask obsession? Check out my new video before it gets removed! 😮
Neutral,@Bookwriter2too,"I just love the way Senator Kennedy just talks like you or I would, no wonder he keeps getting reelected, like President Trump, he is one of us, not a masked swamp creature from hell."
Neutral,@Jefbishop79,"Unless a real doctor can tell me that masks actually work, I’m walking around everywhere I go without one. I dare anyone to confront my 6’3” 250 pound ass with force. This is communist tyranny and we should all fight back!"
Neutral,@Jefbishop79,"Can any real Americans besides myself refuse to put on a mask when they go out in public and into businesses? It’s been overdue that we tell everyone to fuck off and reclaim our civil liberties, civil rights, and our damn respect. This so-called “pandemic” is a manufactured crisis that is less fatal than the flu. Wake up!!"
Neutral,@jerrybaker,"Remember remember the...all of November. 3 November Election. 5 November Million Mask March. Also 5 November, I'm still predicting widespread violence from BLMantifa Terrorists and their Liberal allies. Also 5 November, I wouldn't be surprised if POTUS and Q make a Call To Arms.  All through November, the Storm will be upon us."
