Neutral,@Deh0414,The single biggest proof that lockdowns and masks are not a strategy and do not work other than creating more death and misery
Neutral,@Deh0414,Half of all black workers in MN are out of work thanks to lockdowns and probably also the rioting. What is so hard for Republicans to provide a bold contrast?
Positive,@Cre8tiv62,"Today at Sams Club i was told at checkout that i need to use curbside pick up because i didnt wear a mask. In all honesty i am medically exempt, so says the exceptions to the rule from our state Gov. So even though my condition falls under the ADA, i cant shop inside. I wont be bullied. I wont wear a mask. I will breathe the virus laden air because you cant run and hide from anything microscopic. Masks keep you from building your immune system, and i think thatâ€™s what the ignorant elected officials want.  #votetrump2020  #vote LuciferLeftOUT"
Negative,@ironsam96,"â€ªDoes anyone else find it odd that leftists in the COVID-19 era decry getting haircuts and beers but somehow itâ€™s okay to have done dental work, where various artifacts from my maskless mouth are socially acceptable aerosols for an hour or more? ðŸ¤”â€¬"
