Positive,@FrizzyLizzee,Know what you are doing to your health if you wear a mask.
Positive,@Cj_dalton,"So in sports news today, Mahomes signs a multi-Million $$ deal with the Chiefs at the same time the Washington Redskins are proposing changing their name due to systemic racism, AT the same time Kaepernick signs his million $$ deal with Disney. If the Hypocrisy isn‚Äôt reading loud & clear to you, then you‚Äôve drunk the Kool-Aid!  It‚Äôs a BUSINESS! Anyone that calls it a sport, is as delusional as calling rioters ‚Äúpeaceful protestors‚Äù.  How do we solve this? Well if a doctort provides you with bad service, you stop going to him and stop referring him to all your friends, if a business MAKES you wear a mask to provide a service, all you have to do is walk away and not patronise that business! Wake up people! #NFail #parlerusa #whatwouldjesusdo"
Positive,@courtSTAR,Are mask mandates really necessary and isn‚Äôt this a violation of our freedom?
Positive,@C_ap13,Toronto has made masks mandatory in indoor public spaces. What‚Äôs next? Why the lockdown if masks work?
Negative,@DeplorableHousewife,It's Just a Mask!! #NoMask
Negative,@DylanWheeler511,Take your masks OFF!!!! This is a fairly easy experiment to duplicate. Masks appear to lower your environmental oxygen level SIGNIFICANTLY. Which would mean you're starving your brain for oxygen when you wear them. Meaning you‚Äôre slowly killing yourselves.
Negative,@GregB87,They wouldn‚Äôt let me into Walmart today because I wasn‚Äôt wearing a mask. Those stupid democrats are taking all my rights away. #trump2020 #nomoremasks
Negative,@carpedonktum,"Went to the post office today, and some guy was freaking out that half of us weren't wearing masks. No I didn't record it, I don't make fun of the mentally disabled(that aren't running for President of the Senate)  Fun fact: Once he left, everyone, masked and unmasked said, asshole, almost in unison. Normal people are done with this crap"
Neutral,@AntonioSabatoJr,"If the mask does really work why isn‚Äôt our country fully open? Just wear your stupid mask and problem solved, right? No, because it is all a bunch of lies & huge BS folks."
Neutral,@Bingon2long,I have a friend that has many health problems that makes it difficult to breath and is tired of being shamed for not wearing a mask. I just made her a mesh mask that will allow her to breath easy and comply with stupid rules.
Neutral,@gaypatriot,It's just a mask? It's just two weeks. It's just non-essential businesses. It's just to keep from overwhelming the hospitals. It's just until cases go down more. It's just to keep others from being scared. It's just for a few more weeks. It's just until we get a vaccine. It's just a few side effects. It's just to let people know you're safe to be around. It's just for the coronavirus vaccine. It's just a few more months. It‚Äôs just a video. It‚Äôs just an email account. It's just for protecting others from hate speech. It's just a few people. It's just a credit card company.  It's just a little chip. It‚Äôs just for medical information and paying for things. It‚Äôs just so you can travel. It‚Äôs just so you can get your driver‚Äôs license. It‚Äôs just so you can vote. It's just for a few more years. It's just a statue. It's just a building. It's just a song. It‚Äôs just a piece of paper. It's just a flag. It's just a piece of cloth. It's not just a piece of cloth. It's not just a mask.
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a mask....‚Äù
Neutral,@AntonioSabatoJr,Please shove your mask and your stupid liberal views up your ass thank you.
Neutral,@courtSTAR,Happy 4th everyone!!! üá∫üá∏üí• celebrating a mask free day!
Neutral,@AntonioSabatoJr,Wearing this mask is freaking stupid just like the law makers who are implementing and forcing it down our throats. I am done with BS!
Neutral,@Amykris1124,"This needs to go viral. Meanwhile, governors are shutting states down again, schools are mandating kids over the age of 2 wear masks all day in the fall, and some beaches remain closed. When will we wake up?!"
Neutral,@Clinton614,-They closed your business -They closed your church -They closed your parks -They closed your beaches -They banned funerals -They banned graduations -They made you wear masks -They banned Dad's in delivery rooms But they allowed this üëá we were played!
Neutral,@C4VaxS,I will not let the government inject me with the #COVID19vaccine Echo if you feel the same. #Patriots
Neutral,@BrendaStewart,"Todd Lowdon (@tlowdon) Tweeted: Updated US 7-Day Avg CASES vs DEATHS graph which highlights the cases upturn beginning around June 9. The CDC reports mean time from symptom onset to death of ~14 days. Cases are now skewing younger & milder, but still no deaths curve inflection despite the marked increase. The trend still looks really good. We should stay the course for herd immunity"
