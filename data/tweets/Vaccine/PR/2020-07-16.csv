Neutral,@Barbiergiselle,"Germany and Austria calling out COVID for what it is, a hoax. More investigation is necessary to impose lock down restrictions. There is something very wrong about this. WAKE UP"
Neutral,@Barbiergiselle,This video shows medical doctors in Austria and Germany questioning the virus and unnecessary restrictions for lock down around the world. Things don't make sense and it looks as the virus is another from of cold. Find this video in English. This virus is a hoax and we must discover together the reason for restrictions on citizens. Something more sinister is going on. WAKE UP!
Positive,@Hearronsnest,If masks work why didnt they give them to prisoners instead of releasing them???
Positive,@CanadaJill,Mask wearing just became mandatory in my community. Not sure how I feel about this. The cases in my region are low and mostly in care homes for the elderly. Any other Canadians out there have mandatory mask bylaws where they live?
Positive,@Conniedlopes,Britain 'WILL consider telling people to wear face masks in public'
Negative,@anitakmiller,"‘Print this article and hand it to frightened mask wearers who have believed the alarmist media, politicians and Technocrats in white coats. Masks are proven ineffective against coronavirus and potentially harmful to healthy people and those with pre-existing conditions.’ #NOMASKS"
Negative,@blaze99,"So, I think it is time for Gov DeSantis to open back up and take the masks off since the positive tests were made up."
Negative,@Derek,Dr. Fauci was caught by Americas Voice News for taking his mask off when the hearing was over. You can’t make this up.

Neutral,@CruelMaverick,"Lincoln County, Oregon issues face mask order for WHITE PEOPLE ONLY. Non-whites not required to wear masks out of fears it could cause a ""stigma"" against colored people wearing masks... WTF?!?!?! Check out the video by  @Timcast  below and consider subscribing to his YouTube channel. #COVID19 #Oregon #Racism"
Neutral,@GhostRaven,"I watch Dan Bongino every morning, a great way to start my day is a day started with Truth. I love a place I know I can turn to that I can trust. Today was great. I don't blame you at all #dbongino this whole mask thing is BS in the fact that they think we cannot use our own judgement. I think at my age (older than Dirt accourding to my grown kids) I can make up my mind when a mask is warrented. I take care of a Cancer patient and would never endanger her. I take percausions around others but will not be controlled by a society who wants to become a member of the communist controlled China arm. Day by day I see one freedom after another being taken away. If the dems get their way we will be a sister country of the CCP. I will fight that to my last breath. I feel sorry for the everyday chinese people who have to live under the CCP for they have no choice. If they had the means they would fight and we should fight to make sure we keep our independence."

Neutral,@Hearronsnest,Do osha standards still exist? My husband is suffering from a terrible headache. The mask he is forced to wear is starving his brain of oxygen.
Neutral,@JoeyTwoCups,"According to the CDC over 2,300 people die of heart disease each day. Also, according to the CDC, 370 people died from the #Coronavirus today. It’s far more about what you put in you then what you put on you. #masks"
