Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"An apartment complex in Ventura County, CA is locking their residents inside the building until all of them are tested for Covid. I called the number, was put on hold, & then eventually forwarded to voicemail. This is the dangerous slope we‚Äôve been talking about - & it‚Äôs exactly what the Cabal wants. They don‚Äôt even have to mandate laws or draft legislation when landlords, banks, businesses, etc. will go along with the agenda & require this out of their tenants /customers. And what happens if 1 child tests positive in a public school setting? Will they lockdown that entire school until every kid is forcefully tested then shipped to a ‚Äúquarantine facility‚Äù if positive? This is called tyranny & it never ends up well for us citizens. It‚Äôs time to wake up & fight for our God-given rights. #WWG1WGA"

Positive,@GodisLife,"What‚Äôs y‚Äôalls take on the masks? I feel like in certain instances, in order to beat these scumbags at their own games, without escalating to potential violence, those who don‚Äôt mind wearing them, should. I for one, will not and have only twice. That was only because I was pressured by a customer, and the communist sign on Home Depot‚Äôs door. Thankfully my wife stood strong and didn‚Äôt wear one, which quickly prompted me to take mine off. My mask was a turban I got in Iraq. I had it on my face like the terrorists do. If you have to wear a mask, I recommend you wear the most ridiculous one you can find."
Positive,@Clinton614,"""I wear a mask to protect you, so you need to wear a mask to protect me."" - That is so nice of you! Then if we are on the topic of protecting each other, that is why I carry a firearm. To protect you in case something went down. Do you carry a firearm to protect me? ""Well no"" -Why not? ""Because it's a gun...I don't want to."" -It doesn't matter, if it could protect me, you should do it. -Look, the moral of the story is, I carry a firearm because my safety is my own responsibility. I would never expect someone else to keep me safe. -Do you hear how stupid you sound now? #clinton614"

Neutral,@austenjlennon,I don't post to make myself popular... I don't post just for conservatives or republicans. I post when I see something idiotic on either side... and I see an awful lot of right-wing idiots about the issue of Masks masks masks masks... be an idiot AFTER Trump gets re-elected... stop giving the media more food for the crazy left.
Neutral,@Callmecrazy1389,"Facebook put me in ""jail"" 24 hours lol From an OSHA Inspector: I wanted to put this out there. I have worked in a clean room for 23 years and 10 years on Submarines before that. OSHA is the standard that you have to live by in these environments. So for the people that are going to say, listen to the experts, OSHA would be those experts on face masks. Please read the following with an open mind. Not going to change the mind of the hard core believers, but it would be nice for those people to not attack us that are not, as not caring. Not going to debate this, just putting it out there. COPIED FROM AN OSHA CERTIFIED GENTLEMAN:  If you care, then share.  For all you mask wearers (especially those of you who think wearing it outside is NOT stupid ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è). I know I‚Äôm about to burst your ‚Äúgoogle doctor degree‚Äù bubble, but here goes nothing.  So Masks?  I am OSHA 10&30 certified. I know some of you are too. I don‚Äôt really know WHY OSHA hasn‚Äôt come forward and stopped the nonsens"
Neutral,@HoppyWoods,Mask? Social Distancing?
Neutral,@deplorablez,Sounds like she won't be wearing a mask.
Neutral,@floridaborn,The mask police got David Harris. No more American Airlines.
Neutral,@JohnGThrower,The medical mask madness with Dr Fauci and attacks on freedom at Tim Hortons. #freedom #FauciFail
Neutral,@AcePhillips,Look at this picture for 3 seconds. That should give you plenty of time to figure out how stupid this mask mandate is.
Neutral,@BrennanKarenmarie,It has been 44 days since  @GovAbbott48  mandated masks to freedom loving Texans with no liberty lift in sight. Shameful.
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,Big thank you to whoever made this visual. And let‚Äôs not forget the holes are even bigger on the cloth masks....
Neutral,@Clinton614,"Dear Sheep, Doctor fruadski now wants you to wear goggles with your mask and next week he will ask that you stick your finger in your ass and hop on one foot. #clinton614"
Neutral,@ConnieHair,"FLASHBACK: Fauci's 60 Minutes interview where he told people not to wear masks, not because medical personnel need them as people say now, but because they might have unintended consequences from people fiddling with them, making themselves sick."
Neutral,@Cherokeeowl,Fraud Fauci says wear your mask & your googles to prevent hoax virus What about protestors?? Ooooh that‚Äôs different!  Echo if you think this lying POS is a fraud & can‚Äôt be believed!  #gijoevets
Neutral,@austenjlennon,"Malta Coronavirus I doubt that there is enough proof on this planet for the conspiracy theory sceptics... but a locked-in pool party?! Come on people... wear your masks, social distance and wash your hands... it may not be your life you save... but at least you made the effort to stop someone more vulnerable from dying... or is someone's else's life not important to you?  Did I hear 'All Lives matter?'"
Neutral,@ExposingLibsBS,"Dear  @Name Hidden , I‚Äôm not sure what you‚Äôre implying with your silly little meme here? You‚Äôd like to punch me in the face? It would be great fun! You should try. Although I‚Äôd likely break your arm off and beat you with your own bloody stump before you had time to comprehend what had just happened. If this is just another lame ‚Äúracist Nazi‚Äù reference, I agree, punch a Nazi. They suck. Although I will say this, at least these idiots have the courage to show their faces and not hide behind a mask. Which means I still have more respect for them than I do for you. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚úåüèºüñïüèº"
Neutral,@bryanwhite,"I love this view, serving my local church body, Northwest Gospel Church in Vancouver, WA. The COVID-19 event has been nothing but opportunity for me, here and in developing things that will be business assets. I love what I‚Äôve been a part of. But I also terribly miss the people who have not yet returned because they are in the age group that should be protected. If they were coming into the facility I might wear a full gas mask. Two of them have faithfully served on the video team for longer than I know. As much as it‚Äôs been an opportunity in my life, and as much as I‚Äôve never worked as hard as I have the last four months doing what I love, I can‚Äôt wait until we can all be back together. To do life together. To practice our faith together and follow Jesus together. To not have people relentlessly fearing one another."
