Positive,@Cwbolin605,‚Ä™Back of napkin math:‚Ä¨ ‚Ä™By mid August the US will be under 12k new cases per day. (Aggressive est under 8k). Normal Americans will ask if all this was worth it. ‚Ä¨ ‚Ä™Libs will still be telling you to stay home‚Ä¨
Positive,@Fostermonster,Kansas City where I live is wanting to mandate mask wearing. I have not and will not wear a mask. I am so pissed right now. I have not worn a mask since this covid started and I am just fine. Government stay the hell out of my life. I don‚Äôt depend on you so let me make my own decisions. I am a grown woman with connected brain cells.
Positive,@Cwbolin605,"I know it is not new, but: Either social distance and restrict businesses  Or Wear a mask No reason for both"
Positive,@JodiCoccoli,"Months later, first local COVID-19 patient still warns: 'Wear a mask' PROPAGANDA"

Positive,@Fannyfo,"I choose NOT to wear a mask for these reasons, but I don‚Äôt judge others for choosing to wear one. Just don‚Äôt judge me for the choice I‚Äôm making OK? #dontjudgeme #trump2020 #maga üá∫üá∏‚≠êÔ∏èüá∫üá∏"
Positive,@Itsme2k17,This is insane. The county is asking people who are not sick to go get tested. ‚ÄúIt protects others‚Äù. These people r nuts. They just want the numbers to go up! Let‚Äôs see the false positives of these tests. We‚Äôve had influenza around forever and we can‚Äôt get those tests to even be above 70 percent accurate. If you aren‚Äôt sick don‚Äôt wear a mask and don‚Äôt get a damn test. And comments are disabled for these local ads so u can‚Äôt tell people to stop being sheep.
Positive,@bclarkj,"Mask mandates. Want to wear one or need to, wear it. Don‚Äôt force it on others. I social distanced before all this so you don‚Äôt have to worry about me. I don‚Äôt want to be near you any way."

Negative,@DylanWheeler511,Take your masks OFF!!!! This is a fairly easy experiment to duplicate. Masks appear to lower your environmental oxygen level SIGNIFICANTLY. Which would mean you're starving your brain for oxygen when you wear them. Meaning you‚Äôre slowly killing yourselves.
Negative,@Derek,Dr. Fauci was caught by Americas Voice News for taking his mask off when the hearing was over. You can‚Äôt make this up.
Negative,@carpedonktum,"Went to the post office today, and some guy was freaking out that half of us weren't wearing masks. No I didn't record it, I don't make fun of the mentally disabled(that aren't running for President of the Senate)  Fun fact: Once he left, everyone, masked and unmasked said, asshole, almost in unison. Normal people are done with this crap"

Negative,@BeautyandBrains,Guess what guys! Sooo I went to the Tulsa Trump rally and my work found out about it. I‚Äôve been working from home since.... they made me get a Covid test before I could come back to work.... well guess what! Results just in .... NEGATIVE!!  What the media won‚Äôt tell you is that THOUSANDS of UNMASKED üò± Trump supporters came together to support our wonderful President and we‚Äôre all FINE.  Covid is HYSTERIA being used for a political purpose!!!  MAGA TRUMP2020
Neutral,@AntonioSabatoJr,"If the mask does really work why isn‚Äôt our country fully open? Just wear your stupid mask and problem solved, right? No, because it is all a bunch of lies & huge BS folks."

Neutral,@cjtruth,"Great New  @StormIsUponUs  video. A must see! You're being scammed by enemies of America who occupy powerful positions in government and the media. November 2020 is the way we, the people, can fight back. Know your enemy. Ditch the masks. Rise. #Covid911 youtu.be/-fhGV1LxeKQ"
Neutral,@Fostermonster,Looks like Kansas will be getting our money since our worthless mayor made masks mandatory starting Monday in Kansas City. We have the worst health director who is a staunch liberal. You want to ruin Kansas City you will succeed cause we will cross state line and do all of our shopping there. What a bunch of crap.
Neutral,@ConservativeAmericanWoman,"Nazi Napa, Ca!!! The latest idea from the scared liberals. TICKETING for not wearing masks basically.. read on. The Napa County Board of Supervisors is considering allowing County staff to issue citations, similar to parking or speeding tickets, to individuals and businesses who are not complying with State and County health orders in cities and unincorporated areas of the county. The Board will discuss a new urgency ordinance, along with amending the County Code Compliance Manual to allow enforcement of State and County health orders, during their meeting scheduled for Tuesday, July 14, 2020. #napa #parler #nazicalifornia #california #reopencalifornia #recallnewsom #liberals #liberallogic #unconstitutional #iprotest #freeamerica #napavalley #winecountry"
