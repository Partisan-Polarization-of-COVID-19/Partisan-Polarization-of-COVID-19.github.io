Neutral,@F0RtheRepublic,"This is absurd, I can't be the only one who sees how blow out if proportion this is? Mailing everyone masks?? Come on! There's no garuntee that these cloth masks will actually prevent anything yet what can be garunteed is thousands of people struggling to breathe and becoming irritated from wearing these pointless masks! This is all a ploy to get people use to accepting restrictions on their freedoms. The old Communist trick is to take 2 steps forward and 1 step back... Remember when they said it would be optional? Now it's mandated... Wake up people, we are being duped."
