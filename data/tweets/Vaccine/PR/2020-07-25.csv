Positive,@CommunistCrusher,"Alyssa Milano told the redskins their name was racist, while she promoted the name in the past. Alyssa Milano, told you to wear a mask, yet wore a crochet mask. Alyssa Milano, screams “you’re racist” yet darkened her skin for publicity. Alyssa Milano who screamed #MeToo yet still promotes Joe Biden. Hmmm 🤔"
Negative,@HubLife,This man understands the mask lie at a level most can't comprehend. Echo this everywhere. #Trump2020 #NoMasks
Negative,@EstherMcCune,"I went to get my vehicle registration today. First day they were opened. Our clerk is a sweet lady but she had to follow exceptionally strict guidelines. (Keep in mind our heat index was over 100 today and there was zero shade). So they were only allowing like maybe 10 ppl inside and everyone else had to remain in a line outside. It seemed like roughly half hour or so wait outside. So much sweat, sunburn, etc. (the poor baby I saw 😩). The second you touched that door your mask had to be on. After about 5 minutes I’m ready to pass out from heat exhaustion combined with the oxygen deprivation. Had to take my mask off and go get some water. These stupid cloth masks are way too thick for breathing! How do people wear these all day?"
Neutral,@EstherMcCune,When a government website states that cloths masks INCREASE virus risk. Oops.  #covid19 #conservative #masks #masksdontwork #mandates
Neutral,@FancyBitchHere,Oregon is not requiring blacks to wear masks. So won’t they catch Covid? So if all this mask “science” is right they are trying to kill the black community 🤷🏼‍♀️
Neutral,@Brockstory,Wear the co2 tank oh I mean #mask

Neutral,@Cherokeeowl,"The idiots who are Rioting, looting, destroying, & demanding masks are the smallest % of the population with the loudest voices.  Why do we put up with this behavior???  We need to push back - Resist!  I’m tired of it!  #gijoevets"
