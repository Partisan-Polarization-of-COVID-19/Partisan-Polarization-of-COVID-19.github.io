Positive,@jammie56,"Once again commie governor Charlie Baker (aka Faker) of Massachusetts has added more covid mandates. Must now wear a mask inside or outside even if more than six feet away. Also set a stay at home advisory from 10pm to 5am starting Friday except work, food orders, etc. Restaurants have to stop serving tables at 9:30 PM. No more than 10 people indoors or 25 outdoors. Fine me if you want, but I will NOT wear a mask outside...especially if I'm more than six feet away. This tyrant RINO has to go."
Neutral,@ANNtheWARDEN,"New Zealand announces ‘quarantine camps’ where positive patients will be forcibly placed With only 25 coronavirus deaths among a population of nearly 5 million, medical officers are now being directed to manage all positive confirmed cases in a quarantine camp."
Neutral,@FayewrayLw,"She wants the public to spy for her? Wow she is power hungry.  Also, stop putting covid 19 positive patients in nursing homes! Nursing homes do not have the PPE right now to take care of them and we have to reuse the gowns and masks then we infect others by having to reuse the gowns and masks! I have been a nursing assistant for 10 years. All this time, the rules from the CDC was always throw away your PPE before leaving the patients room. Well now it is supposedly okay to wear them in every room! It is not right! Even with residents that do not have covid. This is how it gets spread. If we would had the proper PPE, we could change it out after every patient and it possibly wouldn't spread as bad. A lot of nursing homes dont want to spend the money on the PPE.  Also, we are supposed to quarantine the residents that have it. So what do you do if that resident doesn't want to listen and visit other residents in their rooms? Call the cops and they get put on psych hold. 72 hours."
Neutral,@JimJordan,Republicans:  Liberty. Not lockdowns.  Freedom. Not socialism.  Opportunity. Not mandates.
Neutral,@Cnorthupku,DOCTORS/CDC SAY YOU HAVE A 99. 997% OF SURVIVING CORONA.  NO VACCINE NECESSARY DRACONIAN LOCKDOWNS WERE PLANNED FOR THIS ELECTION TO PUSH MAIL IN BALLOTS AMERICA WAKE UP.  YOU FEEL BETTER WEARING A MASK DO IT BUT GO BACK TO WORK OPEN YOUR BUSINESSES.
Neutral,@canadiancommentor,"I just don't understand it. I work among scientists, most of whom are not high risk for death or complications from COVID. They are all terrified. My school-age kid will be fine; if he gets it (which I assume he will) the numbers show that the flu is deadlier. Heck, if I, a middle-aged man, get it, I am barely more likely to die from this than the flu. People are panicking and it's just not mirrored in the data. The panic porn from the media has set in and it's shocking to see people freaking out. The lockdowns will have a big effect--in fact they already are having it. Businesses are shutting down and people are losing their incomes. In addition, the mask mandates are going to have long-term consequences, especially for kids; they won't be very good at reading facial communication. This whole gong show is making me shake my head at the state of fear and lack of foresight in terms of unintended consequences in even the most educated people. Sigh."
Neutral,@CraigTheTechTeacher,"""What this translates to is at least 2 years of the proper balance of power. The primary issues surrounding voting for Donald Trump included shutdowns, court packing, the green new deal, socialism, late-term abortions, and more. With a power gain in the house and retention of the senate, this means Republicans can block the far left nonsensical proposals made by the far left over the next four years."" #News #FakeNews #MSM #Republican #Victory #Trump #Election #Election2020"
Positive,@2Obvious,"Today an old man and his partner accused me of not being concerned about their health because I wasn't wearing a mask.... I turned it around on him and said I am very concerned about their health that is why I don't wear a mask... 80% of new infections occur while wearing a mask, 3% occur without."

Positive,@IdahoJohn,Has anyone else noticed whenever Biden goes out and talks now he doesn’t wear a mask?

Positive,@alexiskraussart,"ECHO if you think we need a total REDO OF THE ELECTION, with IN PERSON VOTING. That would solve the problem of this vile fraud. Extreme actions warrant extreme measures.  I don't give a damn if they arrange it so that one person enters the voting room at a time with a gas mask on - just as long as it's in person with an ID! If people can go out and burn cities down while shoulder to shoulder with one another, or go buy flowers for their garden - or any number of unnecessary things that people have been doing despite the ""risk"" of COVID19 (which is only a concern if you're in a small percentile), they can be a damn American and vote the way that it is supposed to be done. The COVID19 fear-mongering and consequent mail-in ballot ""solution"" was an ingenious, brain-washing scam devised to sway the election. It worked. Pass this on and get the message out if you agree. Let's fight for our freedom.  _____ #parler #election #electionfraud #2020election #trump2020 #voterfraud #freedom"
Negative,@JackvoteTrump,Trump Has Torn the Mask Off the Liberal Media - WSJ
Neutral,@HesheyT,"They underestimated the will of the people. I think they look at all the masked people and think they got this. Masks equals slaves: all throughout history. These days they fooled many that it may save them and others from something that has a 99.97% survival rate. Either way, have no fear God is still running this show."

Neutral,@Jjbrek91,"What is happening with the Blue run states, trying to “mandate” households and relatives from getting together and celebrating during thanksgiving and Christmas. And wearing masks INSIDE our own homes. They are insane. Communism at its finest. GET OUT TO VOTE AND BRING OTHERS WITH YOU!!"

Neutral,@billylincoln,Republican patience is reaching a whole new stress test right now... We let them riot. We let them bash our heads in. We let them censor us. We let them ban us. We let them call us racist. We let them tear down statues. We let them shout at us while we ate. We let them shoot our Congressmen. We let them lock us down. We let them mask us. We let them march on our freeways. We let them block our cars. Now we're letting them block our poll observers. Are we going to let them steal an election too? #STOPtheSTEAL #Trump2020 #MAGA #KAG #1776
Neutral,@gordontrema,"The media lost their minds when President Trump told Americans to not let COVID-19 dominate our lives. Doesn't he know the virus is a tragedy? What kind of leader would ever say such things?! Oh, I don't know, how about FDR: ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself"". Or George W. Bush after 9/11? Or Ronald Reagan after the Challenger disaster? Or Winston Churchill when it seemed like the Allies were losing WWII? Our choice has never been more clear: This is a battle between hope and fear, not Trump and Biden. And the American spirit chooses hope! This was on Glen Beck and he is 100 percent Right!!. Does anyone know Biden's plan Oh lets see to get those Shots out when they are through lets make sure we all have those Masks which we all do . OH lets scare everyone to death about The Dark Winter. OH yeah lets not give them Hope for What good is Hope to the Dem's RIght.........."
Neutral,@edie,"Second, when all the political BS is peeled back, there is not one single Mayor or Governor that can honestly say that they did not get what they needed and more, to keep the medical system from being overwhelmed. Mobile field hospitals went unused. Naval hospital ships went unused. Charity mobile hospitals went unused. The private sector and Americans stepped up and met the PPE needs. The partnership between the White House and the private sector cranked out ventilators and not only met the needs, but replenished the emergency stockpiles. Not one, but multiple variations of vaccines have been discovered and are in final trials in the fastest time in history. So, take your secret plan and shove it. I am too old to buy into snake oil scams and too experienced to not look at the real evidence/record."
