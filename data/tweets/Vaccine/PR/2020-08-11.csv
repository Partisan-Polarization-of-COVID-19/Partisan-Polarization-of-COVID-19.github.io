Neutral,@Americansforpeace,"The awakening is here, the recent shutdowns, government sponsored interruption of small business,and the curtailing of our civil liberties. When i run i fully intend on getting the D.C. mob out of our back yard. 1) As many of you know, I walked away from the D party in Feb. This decision came after watching that same party avocate for a socialistic society. I witnessed my family in Venezuela experience these same rights stripped from them. I have been warning Americans since the day I walked away, that we were headed down this same road. This is why I decided to run for U.S. Congress in TX CD8 2022. I refuse to sit on the sidelines and watch the D party destroy our cities. I promise to do everything in my power to protect the American people and our inalienable rights granted to us by the Constitution of the United States of America! WAPC🇺🇸✌️🏳️‍🌈"
Positive,@DewsNewz,"We sooo stupid now, we read side of mask box and New England Journal of Medicine article. People who don't wear a mask have lower cognitive ability, says study"
Positive,@ChrisHendrickson,"If I have to wear a mask for YOUR health, I also reserve the right to slap that cheeseburger out of your hand. #covid19hoax  #masksdontwork"
Neutral,@Georgeforbis,"Masks have been touted as not protecting the wearer from the virus, but a means to protect the wearer from spreading it, so he got it while In an environment with a majority it masks. If anything this shows masks are useless, but now all the sudden because it fits an agenda, him not wearing one is being pushed as the reason he got it."

Neutral,@FreeEarthlings,"I’m NOT a doctor, so I urge everyone reading this to research further and consult with your medical physician the information I’m sharing to see if it may be useful to you.  I’m an asthmatic former patient and survivor of the #CCPvirus. My doctor in Madrid saved me in a matter of hours from a severe dry cough that was suffocating me by treating me with IV drips of #Glutathione (Tationil).  In addition, as a preventative measure I have been taking NAC (N-Acetyl Cysteine) daily and haven’t gotten sick again. I have also been cheating on wearing a mask as much as I can.  For those that don’t wish to take narcotics, maybe Glutathione is for you. I don’t want more people to feel shortness of breath it is horrible. Blocking medical research and constructive discourse during a pandemic is evil. I hope this helps out people get back to their lives, to stop living in fear. The push to force vaccines on us is unnecessary and also it’s obvious it’s more about their pockets than our health."
