Negative,@imhereover,Thinking about mask mandates. All of my reading tells me there is no mask in existence that can stop an airborne virus. A surgical mask is designed to protect a patient From being infected by medical personnel with a staff infection. When you compare size difference between bacteria and virus it's obvious why. If one bacterium where the size of the Queen Mary ocean liner 1 virus particle would be the size of a single porthole on that ship. The only thing that stops airborne virus is a complete haz mat suit with hood and and outside air supply like in a level 3 or 4 lab. So they only thing a mask does is give people a false sense obscurity and politicians a God like power to use force us to submit to their whims.

Neutral,@BJM1776,"@ChrisSalcedoShow Local Station's Twitter feed reports that former Fort Worth Whataburger employee, who recently lawyered up, was ""fired for wearing BLM mask."" As we know this is patently untrue. The employee offered her two-weeks notice and was told that she didn't need to come back for those two weeks. She resigned, period. I doubt her case goes anywhere but I am parlaying to you to share what is a blatantly dishonest report unless it was made in error. If it was made in error, the station (1080 KRLD) should make an immediate retraction and correction. Curious to hear you thoughts. Receipts are below.
