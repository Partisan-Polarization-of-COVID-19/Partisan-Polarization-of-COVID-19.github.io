Neutral,@FlipItRed2024,"“The mask mandate forces every Michigander, including Plaintiffs, to become the government’s patient without the citizen’s consent.” Religious school sues Michigan over new mask mandate."
Neutral,@AZCowboyConstitutionalist,"I’ve been saying this for months. Not only do masks not filter airborne viruses, but they act like a petri dish tied to your face. Surgical masks were designed so surgeons wouldn’t cough out bacteria onto where they are operating, not an inbound filter. They are disposed after at most 2 hours of use."
Neutral,@JimHVAUSA,"I had been on Federal Grand Jury duty all this year (twice per month). When the Obama-appointed federal judge (Urbanski) instituted a mask order for the court house, I wrote him a letter explaining that his order was a violation of my #Constitution al rights to make my own medical decisions as well as express myself freely. He excused me from further service. #meme #covid #masks #FREEDOM #OpenAmerica"

But the fear this rag of a paper wants to instill in us has a purpose to promote its far-left ideology."
