Neutral,@1776stonewall,"An Oregon doctor, Dr. Steven LaTulippe, has his medical license revoked simply for questioning the effectiveness of face masks and for comparing Covid-19 to the common cold. . . and most importantly - for attending a Pro-Trump ""Stop The Steal"" rally. The Oregon Medical Board issued an emergency suspension to revoke his license. . At the Stop the steal rally Dr. LaTulippe said ""I want you to know that I never shut down during the entire COVID season, from the time it was declared till now. I hate to tell you this, it might scare you, but I and my staff, none of us once wore a mask in my clinic. And how many problems did we have in our clinic from that? Zero! Absolutely none."". . . This is what the left does, folks. If you go against the narrative they destroy your career. Remember that Canadian professor who proved that the polar bears in the arctic were thriving? That there was actually over 40,000 of them there? She was fired for that, because it disproved a huge global warming lie"
