Positive,@hardwood64,"Okay so I'm in Arizona where the covid cases are mysteriously skyrocketing the closer we get to the election. My friend's grandfather who is on a pacemaker and has numerous other ailments, recently felt strange so he went in for a test and it cane back positive (of course) and all they did was send him home with basic instructions on what to look for before he feels he should come back in? That seems REALLY shady to me. I'd hate to think they are fudging the numbers so they can justify this mandatory mask/mail-in voting crap? They wouldn't do that....right? üòê Well I think everyone should keep what happened to my friends grandpa in mind in case you know anyone that this has happened to also, maybe a second opinion in this case is called for? Just sayin'...."
