Neutral,@CallumAntliff,"It is a great upset, to see Trump President and First Lady Melania Trump test positive for COVID-19. I wish them a speedy recovery, I’m sure they’ll look after each other as they get though quarantine and this difficult time! However, looking through social media and seeing death wishes and threats is despicable. You may not like the man, or don’t agree with everything they say but at the end of the day they’re still human and important people in the world. Just like when Boris Johnson had the virus, they wished death on him even in his hospital bed.  Threats are coming from the other end of politics, left wing supporters and voters. At least be the better people and not stoop so low.

Negative,@gregyost7777,"I just read this morning our POTUS has contracted Covid-19. My prayers are with him and FLOTUS. This is realization moment. If the most protected family in the world can't escape the virus no mask, distancing or other restraint will protect us. Time for the old normal. Go back to living your free lives without covid constraints. Long live Lady Liberty, Hold up the Stars and Stripes, uphold the Constitution."

Neutral,@Hleshley,Chris Wallace Is out now slyly intimating Trump should have expected this because he’s a “mask denier “ piss on Chris Wallace
Neutral,@DannALbenDalton,"Hey Maskachists, if following the rules was what this was about, the Colorado state Congress would have legislated against not wearing a facemask. A dictatorial mandate is not a ""law"". It's like gun laws, do they obey the ""rules"" , the Constitution? It is our RIGHT to act normal. The burden of proof is supposed to be the government responsibility, but that is to prove violation of LAW, say it with me, LAW. Our Governor was not elected to make law, but our legislators were. If charged with spreading a virus, it would have to be proved that one did it. Basically, people are charged with not pretending that they are guilty of carrying a virus."
Positive,@DannALbenDalton,"The whole idea of reducing the spread for the risk of the spread questions any intellectual honesty one may have. Contact with the virus is how vaccines work. Contact with the virus is also how herd immunity works. The main difference lies in the delivery system that delivers the virus to the human beings. The natural delivery system of the virus to the human does not involve catalysts. It's also void of human efforts, profit motives, science as mandated human knowledge. Counterintuitive it has always been to think this delivery system should involve things other than the proven respiratory system."
