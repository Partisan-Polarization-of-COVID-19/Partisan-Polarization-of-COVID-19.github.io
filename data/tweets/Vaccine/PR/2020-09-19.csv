Neutral,@JamesRWilder62,CONFIRMED: China Launched a Massive Social Media Campaign in March to Get Countries to Adopt Stringent Coronavirus Lockdowns and Destroy Their Economies
Negative,@Aj4gg,"Delta bans an American hero because he took his mask off and yet by Delta’s own admissions, they allow passengers to take them off quickly to eat and drink. Next time someone rushes to eat then chokes and dies on that flight, should sue them into bankruptcy. You can’t make this shit up. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Negative,@Georgiagrits,Wonder how many #governors #mayors doing this. @briankempga where’s your investigation #unmasks and open up #smallbusinesses completely
Neutral,@DREIKORN,"This is an interesting test conducted in Europe regarding the effectiveness of those masks that government and many businesses are telling us we must wear (or else). This study (and many others) shows that the typical masks are not only ineffective in stopping aerosols from leaving a mask, the mask can actually pronounce the distribution of the aerosol into the environment... causing greater risk of contamination. The CDC still does not have peer-reviewed science to base their recommendations... yet mandates continue and citizens (also shoppers and passengers) are told to comply or they will be punished. I get doing my part to help the cause, but when science tells us to question mandates, should we simply shut up and comply or speak out.   What say ye?"
Neutral,@dhaglund0223,"Saw a commercial today for face shields. One line jumped out at me. ""Disposable face masks can cost hundreds over the years."" Uh, huh? Years? Yeah, hard pass. Shove your masks and your shields up your liberal, brain dead, fearful sheeple ass."
Neutral,@DiaNik1,"This should be all over the news, yet “journalists” will continue to obsess over our Presidents tweets, covid and masks. Shameful"

Neutral,@Flirtyskirt,FB just shut down a group of us on Facebook because we don’t want to wear masks. There were over 44k of us. I am heartbroken. The founder has moved to Parler. Spread the word!
Neutral,@Clinton614,"USA USA USA 🇺🇸🇺🇸 The amount of support we had was overwhelming. First time I've felt normal in months. Nobody had on a mask, just about everyone was armed, hundreds of cars driving by honking, waving and showing their support.... This is how you counter a BLM protest and shut them down! #clinton614"
Neutral,@DavidARidenour,Your #facemask may not be providing you the protection from #COVID-19 that you may think. How much protection does yours provide? Take the #cigarsmokechallenge shown one the masters edition of #ScoopTv.
Neutral,@Georgiagrits,Agenda 2021 forced vaccination why rushed human trials are not good.
