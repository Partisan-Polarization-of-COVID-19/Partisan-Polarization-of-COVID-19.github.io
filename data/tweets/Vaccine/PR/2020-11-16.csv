There’s 11 people, you might have that cousin or uncle that doesn’t believe in coronavirus, that thinks it’s a hoax,” he said. “Your family dynamic may allow that person not to be invited or they may have to be at the table, but even if 10 of the 11 self-quarantine before they get there and 1 doesn’t, you’ve reduced the odds of bringing COVID to Thanksgiving from 1-in-10 to 1-in-100, which, again, it’s not fun to play Russian roulette in 1-in-100 chances the bullet’s in the chamber, but it’s a heck of a lot better than playing Russian roulette with a bullet in 1 of 10 chambers.”"

My question:  When AIDS was an epidemic, why were there no laws about wearing a condom imposed?......and HIV/AIDS was a death sentence to everyone.

If obesity is an underlying condition, are you going to arrest the obese for eating to protect them from covid-19? Depriving the body of oxygen will definitely kill me.....
