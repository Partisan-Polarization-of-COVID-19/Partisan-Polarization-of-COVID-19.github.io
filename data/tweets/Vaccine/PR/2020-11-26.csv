Positive,@and503,"Happy Thanksgiving, folk! 🦃 In the past week or two, we've heard that Democrat politicians like California Governor Gavin Newsom and New Jersey Phil Murphy, told their constituents to stay home during these holiday times. Fast forward to the future, they were caught dining with their family and friends and without their masks. And even if they were caught, they still abide with their orders.  But there is one politician that needs to be on the Wall of Shame, and that is Denver Mayor Michael Footpenis....errrr....I mean....Hancock. Hancock urged Denver residents to stay home for Thanksgiving and have themselves a small turkey instead. But this clown was caught traveling to Mississippi to see his wife and daughter. After that happened, he issued an ""apology"" to the city of Denver of his actions. But remember, peasants! Do as I say, not as I do. Again, Happy Thanksgiving! 🦃 #thanksgiving2020  #recallgavinnewsom  #recallphilmurphy  #endshutdowns  #covid19  #denver #colorado"

Neutral,@and503,"Happy Thanksgiving, folk! 🦃 In the past week or two, we've heard that Democrat politicians like California Governor Gavin Newsom and New Jersey Phil Murphy, told their constituents to stay home during these holiday times. Fast forward to the future, they were caught dining with their family and friends and without their masks. And even if they were caught, they still abide with their orders.  But there is one politician that needs to be on the Wall of Shame, and that is Denver Mayor Michael Footpenis....errrr....I mean....Hancock. Hancock urged Denver residents to stay home for Thanksgiving and have themselves a small turkey instead. But this clown was caught traveling to Mississippi to see his wife and daughter. After that happened, he issued an ""apology"" to the city of Denver of his actions. But remember, peasants! Do as I say, not as I do. Again, Happy Thanksgiving! 🦃 #thanksgiving2020  #recallgavinnewsom  #recallphilmurphy  #endshutdowns  #covid19  #denver #colorado"
Neutral,@COLconservative,"Out of sheer curiosity, I got a COVID antibody test yesterday. Since things reopened in mid-May, I have played in two softball leagues, two bowling leagues, gone to the gym regularly, dined out multiple times per week, shopped, been to a casino & traveled, all without fear. I have rarely worn a mask (and when I did it was basically a cloth headband that fit around my nose & kinda mouth that did nothing except get me through the door), won’t touch hand sanitizer, and other than my typical hand hygiene, which has always been good, basically taken no extra precautions. I have also essentially taunted the COVID gods by questioning out loud what I perceive to be the massive overreaction to this virus. I figured if anyone had been exposed it had to be me, although if I had I certainly haven’t known it.  Result: non-reactive (negative). Honestly, this shocked me. Not sure what to think."

Neutral,@Johntopalanchik,"Make Coronavirus Vaccines Public Domain | National Review It turns out that the Moderna vaccine, which was just shown to be 95 percent effective, was actually developed by the company in just two days in January 2020. That’s right, they developed the vaccine in two days in January, but then needed to spend the following ten months performing tests in order to meet the FDA’s standards for vaccine safety and efficacy.” Well, as Bill Frist and I were saying back in 2005, we need a program to speed up vaccine development and deployment. Operation Warp Speed sped things up a lot, but if you’re going to stop a pandemic before a lot of people die — and odds are the next major pandemic will be worse than this fairly mild one — you need a vaccine that can be administered widely in 3 months or less. Note that here a month was lost to a requirement that they have more minority test subjects."
