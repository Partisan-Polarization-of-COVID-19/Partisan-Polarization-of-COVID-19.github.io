Positive,@GinaGrote225,"What happened to “Stay Home, Stay Safe?” What a bunch of BS..."
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"An apartment complex in Ventura County, CA is locking their residents inside the building until all of them are tested for Covid. I called the number, was put on hold, & then eventually forwarded to voicemail. This is the dangerous slope we’ve been talking about - & it’s exactly what the Cabal wants. They don’t even have to mandate laws or draft legislation when landlords, banks, businesses, etc. will go along with the agenda & require this out of their tenants /customers. And what happens if 1 child tests positive in a public school setting? Will they lockdown that entire school until every kid is forcefully tested then shipped to a “quarantine facility” if positive? This is called tyranny & it never ends up well for us citizens. It’s time to wake up & fight for our God-given rights. #WWG1WGA"

Neutral,@Dogwithabone,All the BLM protests was always going to cause case rises but they were all proud to say the risk of Corona was worth it to protest what they believed in. Will they be saying that if their loved ones get ill?  #alllivesmatter #antifabullshit #Boris  : Bradford and London boroughs among 36 'at-risk' areas that could be 'just days away' from local lockdowns
Positive,@FergusFSU,"The angry stares you get from not #WearAMask, compared to absolutely nothing towards people who are wearing their #Masks below their noses tells you this is about control, not public safety from #coronavirus  The obedient lemmings want you to obey unquestioningly like them"

Positive,@GinaGrote225,"Its your responsibility to protect yourself...for instance, wearing a seatbelt...your responsibility, right? You can’t rely on someone not smashing into you. So you do it.  Wear a mask to protect yourself if you’re vulnerable, for the same reason...for those who don’t wear them. It’s not my responsibility to make sure you’re safe, it’s yours.  If everyone acted in their own self interest this would be a non issue. And don’t bitch about people who don’t wear one....just keep your distance."

Positive,@Barbaramackey,Charlie Baker is imposing face mask on the people of Massachusetts. With a 100 dollar fine for non compliance. Grrr
Negative,@AshleyWiebenga,"Since I had some people criticize my homemade mask, and some people made some respectful and valid points, I decided to get a new one. My reason for masking is, 1) If I am asked to, I will wear it, no questions asked, no complaints. This goes for business or people.  2) If I know I'm going to be around people of the vulnerable population. 3) Places that it is absolutely necessary (medical facilities). I still don't agree will the science about them, but I'm not going to be an ass. I prefer not to wear it, but if I have to, I will make a statement. 😊 @TeamTrump #michigan #nomasks #standup #masks #govwhitmer #gretchenwhitmer #executiveorder #maga #kag #trump2020 #freemichigan #protest"

Negative,@bpeterssquare,Millions of parents are deciding to home school their children this coming year rather than put them in public schools under strict CDC guidelines. Development happens only once and I will not be placing my child in a public school under those guidelines. I do not feel that is the proper environment for a child. Until the schools improve their services I will be keeping my child’s development under my care.  - - - #SAVETHECHILDREN #OBAMAGATE #WWG1WGA #qanon #darktolight #followthewhiterabbit #thegreatawakening #socialdistancing #thestormishere #thinkforyourself #patriotsfight #alonetogether #quarantinelife #Godwins #trumptweets #memewar #trumptrain #digitalsoldier #keyboardwarrior #blacklivesmatter #NWO #draintheswamp #sheepnomore #coronavirus #deplorable #buildthewall #covid19 #deepstate #truthseeker #kek #news #truth #masks #qarmy #covfefe #maga #usa #qsoldier #america #history #maga2020  #trump2020  #homeschool  #homeschooling  #schoolchoice  #takebackourschools  #openschools

Neutral,@austenjlennon,I don't post to make myself popular... I don't post just for conservatives or republicans. I post when I see something idiotic on either side... and I see an awful lot of right-wing idiots about the issue of Masks masks masks masks... be an idiot AFTER Trump gets re-elected... stop giving the media more food for the crazy left.
Neutral,@ighaworth,"""The goal here should be to find an effective balance between caution and normalcy, protecting both public health and economic health. The use of masks in indoor public areas is an effective and comparatively effortless part of this balance. The fact that masks have become a political battleground is a travesty for which the blame must fall upon our politicians. I hope those who oppose masks are right. I fear they are wrong.""

Neutral,@ClintKattine,"The truth about masks from doctors. You know, the masks we’ve been forced to wear."
Neutral,@Bunker,Dumb question but if masks are effective......why did they not give masks to criminals in prison instead of releasing them all?
Neutral,@Carolynabrahantes,“jUSt PuT oN tHe maSk”. This virus has an almost 99% survival rate and the main people being affected are the people who have to wear masks every year of their life when flu season hits. You weren’t worried about their health then...
Neutral,@IFBBProHeather,"Just saw a few pics of Judge Janine on Instagram, where she is sporting a muzzle. I mean, a mask. Whatever. Same thing.  I always admired her... she is classy, she speaks the truth, she is blunt, she supports the president because he is trying to do what is right for the country. But now shes doing the mask thing? Come on, lady. Not you too☹☹☹ disappointed."
Neutral,@janlange,♦️It’s just a Mask...  It’s just for two weeks.  It’s just non-essential businesses.  It’s just to keep from overwhelming hospitals.  It’s just until cases go down.  It’s just to keep others from being afraid.  It’s just for a few more weeks.  It’s just until we get a vaccine.  It’s just a few side effects.  It’s just a bracelet to let people know you’re safe to be around.  It’s just an app.  It’s just to let others know who you’ve been in contact with.  It’s just a few more months.  It’s just a video.  It’s just a few people.  It’s just a little chip.  It’s just for medical information or buying something.  It’s just so you can travel.  It’s just a clump of cells.  It’s just a statue. It’s just a building. It’s just a song. It’s just a book. It’s just a movie. It’s just a piece of cloth. It’s just a flag.  It’s just the Jews.  It’s just the undesirables.  It’s just the men.  It’s just the Christians.  It’s just.... wait.... it’s NOT just a mask!

Neutral,@FluffyKittens,"Covid-19 is political. It's a battle between common sense freedom loving people who take personal responsibility for their actions vs. the nanny state government lemmings who live in fear. The nanny state has us outnumbered. But they're also stupid and lazy, so we have that going for us. #FluffySavesAmerica #Masks #Covid"

Neutral,@jgoff87,"When the pandemic hit, President Trump shut down travel from China, then from Europe, then virtually shut down commerce in our entire nation. He worked in concert with various manufacturers to produce the much anticipated need for ventilators, and shipped them across the country to States that requested them along with whatever PPE equipment they needed. He enlisted the best medical experts he could find, consulted the WHO and CDC, and provided daily briefings, some of which were quite lengthy. He tried to encourage American citizens and quell the fear and panic which many were experiencing, assuring them everything was under control… simply meaning that everything that could be done was being done. He urged pharmaceutical companies to create a vaccine, even suggesting they work together if that would help to expedite one. All this was to prevent the spike… the surge of sick patients that the experts assured us was coming which would, undoubtedly, overwhelm the healthcare system…"
Neutral,@DoctorLakeNona,There will not be a safe vaccine .. I did not say not effective but.there will not be a safe vaccine. We have tried to develop corona virus vaccines in the past and all have proven to be very unsafe cause such things as guillian barre syndrome.
Neutral,@ClintKattine,"So let me get this straight: It’s okay for Bill Gates, who’s not a doctor, to come out and say you will need 2 COVID vaccines and they should go to blacks and people of color first. It’s okay for Democrat congressmen to call the Attorney General of the United States a murderer and insinuate he’s a racist. It’s okay for doctors on YouTube to describe the health benefits of eating a placenta. It’s okay for an actress to go on prime time television and proudly state that she wouldn’t be where she is today if she hadn’t aborted her infant. But it’s not okay for a group a board certified physicians from a diverse background to report on the benefits of medications that have been FDA approved for over 60 years and are statistically safer than aspirin?  And it’s more than just not okay, evidence of their entire internet existence must be deleted? Their videos deleted from existence and their website removed from the internet? No, we’re not in Communist China. This is the U.S."
