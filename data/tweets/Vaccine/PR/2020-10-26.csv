Negative,@FreeEarthlings,"Dr. #ReinerFuellmich on #PCRtestScandal  The #Covid19Crisis must be renamed a #CoronaScandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages. How dangerous is the virus? What is the significance of a positive #PCRtest? What is the collateral damage with respect to #health and #economy? An international network of lawyers will argue the biggest #TortCase ever - the #CoronaFraudScandal - which has unfolded into probably the greatest #CrimesAgainstHumanity ever committed. #Scientists and #lawyers recognise that as a result of the deliberate panic-mongering and the corona measures enabled by this panic, #democracy is in great danger of being replaced by #FascistTotalitarian models. To make sure that no one will ever again be in a position of such power as to be able to defraud humanity, or to attempt to manipulate us with their corrupt agendas. #SaveTheEconomy #DefendHumanity #EndLockdowns  #MakeLawLawfulAgain  #GetOffOurRights"

Positive,@2ndAmendment4Me,Thousands more people die from the flu EVERY YEAR not just a few months in a lifetime! No masks ppl get over it in a week and go back to normal life. Common sense if you are sick stay home. Not wearing masks will help ppl become immune to a virus!
Positive,@AZCowboyConstitutionalist,"Just like 2016, all of the media outlets are predicting a victory for Joe Biden in an attempt to get us all to stay home. Not once have I or anyone I know ever received a call from a pollster. Last night I went to a dinner party and met two couples that were Democrats voting for Trump. So interesting hearing their perspectives. They brought it up. How many Biden stickers do you all see out there? They aint gonna show! We will like never before!!!"

Neutral,@ardevinewriter,Ireland on the verge of possible second lockdown. It is impossible to halt the spread of Covid without a vaccine which might never come. Full lockdowns merely kick the can down the road. Destroying the economy & people's lives for a virus that even in severe cases now unlikely to lead to death is a monumental act of self harm.
Neutral,@ChrisMatei,"The @WHO just backtracked on lockdowns, stating that lockdowns do not help at all.  Well, thanks WHO! Took you 9 months. $83 Trillion wiped out. 150M children pushed into poverty. Millions of suicides. Hundreds of millions who lost their job. Where’s the media? #powertrip"
Neutral,@Angry10,Joe Biden (LIEUTENANT LOCKDOWN)) wants continued Lockdowns. Trump wants to open the country back up and protect our seniors and those with underlying medical issues that may be vulnerable. THERE IS A VAST DIFFERENCE . !!

I've seen more crowding on public transit and in Walmarts than I have in public places, with AND without masks. Plus, the stupid hospitals like Kaiser Permanente are advocating for these COVID-19 lockdowns and measures when COVID-19 has LITERALLY a less than 3% chance of being dangerous (yes, I actually did the math, thanks for asking). I'd rather be sick with a cold knowing that it's worse than a coronavirus than be locked up in a shed over a virus that I may or may not catch."

Oh, the W.H.O. is by and large against shutdowns!  The Fourteenth Amendment clause guaranteeing that no state shall “deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.” #fourteenthamendment #covid #shutdown #worldhealthorganization #roevwade"
Neutral,@DaveTheCave,Republicans and Democrats have been profligate with our tax dollars for decades. Now is the time for both to come together to bail out small businesses and unemployed that are in a mess because of government shutdowns. If Republicans have to bend a little to keep businesses open and those who are unemployed solvent so what. Once this pandemic is finished my thought is that both parties will return to their corrupt spending practices and require more tax dollars to do so. Hopefully Trump the outsider will win a second term and put us back on a strong fiscal course.

Europe is heading for disaster, and if biden gets in we will be headed down the same dumb fuck path. The stupidity is getting out of control fear is clouding people's minds. It's the media that is the enemy not the virus. Just my thoughts."
Positive,@2ndAmendment4Me,If our POTUS #TRUMP2020 has the China Virus bc he didn’t wear a mask 😷 and ppl at his rallies also didn’t does everyone (thousands) of people at his rallies now have China virus? No! According to the Biden camp we Trump supporters are doomed! BLM/ANTIFA mobs are excused bc it would be racist to report ppl associated with these terrorists burning looting murdering while not wearing masks ate spreading Covid! The fact is ppl get the flu thousands EVERY SINGLE YEAR and some die that’s life. Many Thousands more than ppl w Covid. Flu season has been happening over a century yet NO MANDATORY MASKS! Why? Masks suppress our immune system and make it impossible to become immune to this virus. That’s a proven fact! Most people have had the flu for over it and been in contact with someone who has it and don’t get sick again bc they are immune to that flu strand. Simple common sense.
