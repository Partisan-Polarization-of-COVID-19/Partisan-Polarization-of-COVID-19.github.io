Neutral,@CraigTheTechTeacher,"""Under the best circumstances, 50% of all small businesses fail in their first five years. Over 100,000 businesses are estimate to have closed for good due to economic shutdowns. Restaurants are the hardest hit among the over 22 million jobs lost from the shutdowns. Many restaurants are small business owned and managed. Let's also not forget, many small business owners operate on thin margins and can only ""float"" paychecks, overhead, invoices, receivables, and losses for 60 to 90 days. All of this spells sleepless nights to the heroes who keep our economy running."" #Economy #Shutdowns #Biden #Trump #Economics #Reopen #Election #Election2020 #Truth #Media #FakeNews #MSM"

Negative,@Christa61183,"So wait just a minute.... you mean to tell me these democrat folks couldn’t go to the polls to vote, but they can be seen dancing in the streets of America partying it up some with no masks, kicking and punching around blow up dolls of Trump. The hypocrisy of the left is astonishing. Just like that COVID means nothing. 🤨🤯🤦🏻‍♀️"
Negative,@IndieThinker79,No mask? No problem? Democrats suddenly found a magical cure for Covid as thousands rally in the streets in celebration of Joe Biden’s “victory” - sans masks.

Neutral,@brittanne93,"I only wear my mask when I go to my daughter's pediatrician or my doctor (through the same liberal hospital network #Vanderbilt) But I won't at any stores that ""require"" it. Not one employee, officer, or other customer has said anything to me EVER... Dare them too. The masks are #fakenews  It's about #control and #fear ... The masks won't save you. Staying 6ft apart WON'T save you from #COVID Stay healthy and be healthy! We will get through this!"
Neutral,@Jffryby,Now I know why all the criminal democrats were wearing their fake fradulant fauci masks....all robbers wear masks and that's exactly what they had planned...rob the election.
Neutral,@ArtemisTexas,"Who do YOU trust on Covid? The answer should that no one has ANY ANSWERS IN ANY COUNTRY. Truth. Contract tracing failed. Masks are only as good as the mask (which most are a damn joke) and the wearer’s adherence to protocol, and washing hands like you have OCD."
Neutral,@DNHarris27828,"Here we go! I can’t believe how stupid people are for voting for this moron! Masks, lockdown, economic failure... 😒 Biden's first move as president-elect? Mask mandate for all. Here's how he plans on doing it. Explore the Fox News apps that are right for you at"

Neutral,@CrystalCross,They are trying to turn us into sheep. Stop the madness people!! Exempt yourself from mask wearing!! ❤️🇺🇸🙏🏼
Neutral,@2ScoopsCam,Could not agree more! I’m disgusted with the sales of “fashionable” masks... like this is something we’re supposed to accept.
Neutral,@AprilBuchman,"Yes the Dems cheated. Glitches in software, computer was hacked. No observers and ballot workers wearing Biden masks"
Neutral,@901Snd,Biden's first move as president-elect? Mask mandate for all. Here's how he plans on doing it. Explore the Fox News apps that are right for you at
Neutral,@Johncindy88,Nooooo! This is not partisan this is fair and balanced journalism. Right. The masks are off and its time the GOP take notice and take measures to protect this country
Neutral,@GregGoeser,"The only mask I'll wear is a #GasMask, to reduce the stench of the rotting bodies of #Biden, #HeelsUpHarris and the piles of #Democrats! ☠️ 🔫 🖕 🤬 🖕"
Neutral,@Deplorablechoir,I’m glad Biden is announcing a lockdown panel and a national mask mandate.  Those idiots will have buyers remorse in time for Trump’s inauguration.
Neutral,@GalwayGal,"These are our great POTUS' accomplishments! He has worked hard for us! If he loses we'll all be to masking and closing down our country again with the corrupt ""basement dweller"" at the helm! LORD hear our prayers!!"

Neutral,@fogcitymidge,Huge street party in San Francisco Castro District for Biden/Harris.  But 20 people socially distanced wearing masks at the White House is a “super spreader event.” 🙄
Neutral,@Christinekayjohnson,"So Dave Chappel opens up on SNL and calls Donald Trump a Racist, talks about White suicide, white people on Drugs. Then says all the white poor people don't want to wear Masks. This crap being Praised on Twitter. Screw them all."
Neutral,@Dmpcf65,Well I guess one positive thing is that since Biden won (stole) the election Corona Virus will suddenly go away . If you don’t believe me look at the turn out yesterday in DC with no one wearing masks .
Neutral,@DebbieDsouza,Good morning Patriots! - the “new president” according to the media is already issuing a mask mandate! -didn’t people accuse Trump of being a dictator? - this guy isn’t even the president and he’s issuing mandates! God help us if he manages to succeed in this colossal heist!
Neutral,@ExposingLibsBS,"After seeing hundreds of thousands of them in the streets across the country last night — without social distancing or masks in many cases — the Democrats do not get to say one more word about COVID.  Every City and State should immediately lift any restrictions. If these Machiavellian hacks can be in the streets, our kids can be in the schools.  I’m done with their reindeer games. I will not comply!"
Neutral,@JewishMolonLabe,"We showed weakness, we OBEYED We wore masks We OBEYED. We locked ourselves home We OBEYED. Commies sensed our weakness, our obedience to authority.
