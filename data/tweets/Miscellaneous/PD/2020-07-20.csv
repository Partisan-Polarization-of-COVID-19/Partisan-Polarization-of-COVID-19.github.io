Positive,@gonebluesotrue,"Hey all. Remember this:  “We are all in it together and the only way we’re going to end it, is by ending it together.”--Fauci #wearamask and take care of America! Thank you."
Neutral,@gonebluesotrue,@trumpteam please tell Vice President Pence that God has answered his prayers by sending people and supplies to make masks which can reduce the spread of the virus only if we wear them.
Neutral,@crypticmxcrowe,"Since you all are a free speech site, this naturally won't offend you. Wouldn't want to be a snowflake, right? Anyways. Donald Trump is a white supremacist pedophile. His followers are ignoring a literal pandemic because masks apparently ""violate their freedom"". Want to know some freedom violations? Immigrant children are being sex trafficked. LGBTQ+ and POC people are being murdered and abused daily. Police are shooting and harming people for voicing their first amendment right. Muslim people are called terrorists and bombers for praying or wearing hijabs. Many people in the porn industry are being extorted and raped. Prison workers have become the nation's ""legal"" slaves. All those children you want born? They're in foster care and being abused. When you say all lives matter, you don't get to pick and choose. Queer lives. Black lives. Disabled lives. Immigrant lives. Muslim lives. Brown lives. Homeless lives. Stop detracting from an equal rights movement. ~"
