Positive,@Bigmossball,"Corona only kills 1%. Yea 1% of the US population is 3million people which significantly impacts everything including the economy for reference, there are 328.2 million people in the US. The damage it does internally to the people who don‚Äôt die is something you might not have to go through but it‚Äôs your responsibility to make things better for your country. If we don‚Äôt get it under control, more than 3million will die. So far, there have been 154 thousand deaths in the US. That‚Äôs more people than was necessary. We have more deaths than anywhere else in the world and you won‚Äôt wear a mask for what? Bc it‚Äôs a little uncomfortable? My mom‚Äôs friend has one of the worst immune systems and cases of asthma you will ever see In your entire life and she still wears a mask. A very small percentage of people who have childhood trauma relating to suffocation cannot wear masks but guess what? They‚Äôre wearing face shields to do their part. Do your fucking part. #coronavirus"

Neutral,@AnnaBortion421,"Dear people who wear their mask over their mouth but not their nose, wtf are you even doing. That's like cutting the tip off a condom and thinking it's still safe."

Neutral,@Doctorwithwound,"Here is some basic information on risk analysis: when we consider risk we make a decision on hazard x probability and then stratify the risk profile. For example hazard = COVID-19 infection and probability of infection in a shop= 0.5 ( a high estimate) then the risk is high. We then determine our risk mitigation strategies. 0% risk = not going to the shops. 100% risk = unprotected social contact with a Covid-19 infected person.Therefore Mitigation of intermediate risk = mask wearing, social distancing etc etc. Simples."

Neutral,@Bklyniri,"The last sentence is the most important. Today, as we struggle with social upheaval, soaring debt, record unemployment, a runaway pandemic, and rising threats from China and Russia, President Trump is actively working to undermine every major institution in this country. He has planted the seeds of doubt in the minds of many Americans that our institutions aren't functioning properly. And, if the president doesn't trust the intelligence community, law enforcement, the press, the military, the Supreme Court, the medical professionals, election officials and the postal workers, then why should we? And if Americans stop believing in the system of institutions, then what is left but chaos and who can bring order out of chaos: only Trump. It is the theme of every autocrat who ever seized power or tried to hold onto it. Retired Admiral William McRaven"

Neutral,@AJGarrett,"Donald Trump was golfing while his ""best friend"" died in the hospital. When will the MAGA cult realize that Donny John's a sociopath who only cares about his reelection?  He claims of the daily deaths from COVID-19: ""It is what it is."" He's actively dismantling the USPS to interfere in an election; this is a constitutional crime that makes Watergate look like minor vandalism. And he's called for fewer tests to keep publicly available numbers down to boost his election prospects. Trump is a conman who will squeeze every last penny out of America for his family, himself, and his supporters. Louis Dejoy, Postmaster General, owns over $70 million in stocks of USPS' direct competition. That is the definition of a conflict of interest. All that said: yes the #wrongtrump did die last night. If God had to take one Trump, then it should have been the wannabe dictator who uses others' lives to enrich himself and keep himself in power. Fuck Trump. #trump2020 #trumptrain #trump2020landslide"
