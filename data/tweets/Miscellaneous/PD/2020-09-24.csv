Neutral,@Groveshard,"Does the devastating effect of Donald Trump’s tyranny include massive deaths in ICU wards from a respiratory illness that is airborne, asymptomatic when contagious, many times more deadly than the flu and without a vaccine, making everyone, even some of the previously-stricken, susceptible, and collapsing of a fairly decent economy ? Trump’s lies about the danger of the pandemic cost lives. HE ~ and everyone with whom he interacted for eight months ~ was tested DAILY before they were allowed to be within his personal space. He simply exhibited the epitome of selfishness."
Neutral,@Damdiver,"SHOCK REPORT: This Week CDC Quietly Updated COVID-19 Numbers - Only 9,210 Americans Died From COVID-19 Alone - Rest Had Different Other Serious Illnesses Sounds about right."
Neutral,@Groveshard,"It took less than 3 months for the death toll attributed to COVID-19 or compliations thereof to reach 100,000. It’s taken just under 4 months to reach 200,000. With no plan in place by the Federal Government, we’ll see 300,000 by February 1st, if not sooner. Half 1 million by next year is not out of the question. 45 & his sycophants can’t/won’t devise a national strategy, instead preferring to allow herd “mentality” (i.e., immunity) to take those with co-morbidities [or not; not everyone who dies exhibits one or more] and allow the rest of the U.S. population to build antibodies & live on. What Donald Trump meant when he said, “It affects virtually nobody !” is those who are white & have fully-funded employer provided medical coverage are barely affected ! He is fooling no one. Kick him and his entire administration to the curb Charge him with malfeasance in “administering” the COVID-19 response; allow all lawsuits against him to proceed."
