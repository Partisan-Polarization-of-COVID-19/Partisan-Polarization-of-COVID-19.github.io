Positive,@ChatByCC,The new spikes in COVID cases. The new restrictions on businesses. The new calls for mandatory mask wearing. Is to shutdown the 4th of July... INDEPENDENCE DAY.
Negative,@DylanWheeler511,Take your masks OFF!!!! This is a fairly easy experiment to duplicate. Masks appear to lower your environmental oxygen level SIGNIFICANTLY. Which would mean you're starving your brain for oxygen when you wear them. Meaning you’re slowly killing yourselves.
Negative,@bpeterssquare,The Obama administration was one of the most corrupt in our history. Looking at the length of the list of crimes it’s amazing this was able to happen under the noses of We The People. These crimes went beneath the radar thanks to an intentional blind eye by the mainstream media and outright obfuscation by certain talking heads. Those crooks in the media should be branded for what they are. The truth is coming out.  - - - - #SAVETHECHILDREN #OBAMAGATE #WWG1WGA #qanon #darktolight #followthewhiterabbit #thegreatawakening #socialdistancing #thestormishere #thinkforyourself #patriotsfight #alonetogether #quarantinelife #adrenochrome #Godwins #trumptweets #memewar #trumptrain #digitalsoldier #keyboardwarrior #blacklivesmatter #NWO #draintheswamp #sheepnomore #coronavirus #pepethefrog #buildthewall #covid19 #deepstate #truthseeker #whitehats #hollywood #justice #news #truth #masks #qarmy #covfefe #maga #usa #5g #2a #1a #america #history #bidengate  #obamaknew  #maga2020  #kag2020  #maga2020

Negative,@carpedonktum,"Went to the post office today, and some guy was freaking out that half of us weren't wearing masks. No I didn't record it, I don't make fun of the mentally disabled(that aren't running for President of the Senate)  Fun fact: Once he left, everyone, masked and unmasked said, asshole, almost in unison. Normal people are done with this crap"

Positive,@darrengrimes,"The police leave these rioters in Brixton to break the law. They allow them to smash police cars, break social distancing regulations and to injure officers. The rule of law is quickly been replaced by the rule of the mob. We need to get a grip – fast."
Positive,@darrengrimes,Things the Left won’t condone: • Winston Churchill • British history • Democratic mandates • Diveristy of thought Things the Left will condone: • Criminal damage • Breaking social distancing for the right cause • Blaming British white people for American policing

Positive,@darrengrimes,"It’s looking likely that I will hit 10,000 followers on Parler today – the fightback starts here. For far too long conservatives have allowed our views, mainstream views, the views of the silent and ignored majority, to be sidelined by a mainstream media with an overwhelmingly left-wing bias that says business is bad and tearing down statues is good. It’s about time we fought back against big tech’s assault on free speech, free expression and freedom of association. It’s about time we ensured our kids aren’t been filled with Marxist, extreme-Left nonsense that teaches them to hate their country – a bloody great one, with a proud history and magnificent people. It’s about time we defunded the BBC. It’s about time we exposed the hypocrisy of those who argue social distancing is sacrosanct but absolutely fine if it’s those whose political views our politicians and media agree with that are flouting the rules and the rule of law. Thank you for your support over the last 24 hours! D"

Negative,@4651lainey,"Kongflu Virus has taken another day off so people can protest, funny how that works"
Negative,@Dennishastly,"Is Johnson really the Tory leader we need? He seems to think the upcoming austerity will be optional. I, and many others, won’t be paying any corp tax for a few years due to Kung Flu, so spending will need to be borrowed and eventually paid back. It’s just a question of when. Longer we wait, the more painful it’ll be."

Neutral,@Beerdedbandit,"Equip tinfoil hat: We've known about covid since December. The death rate seems to follow the same trends as case rate until the end of May. The riots begin and now we have a declining death rate with a climbing case rate. Given about every pass thrown during this whole pandemic has been incomplete, if not intercepted, I am unsure what to belive? I know Colorado began collecting data as ""deaths with vs. Deaths from"" but I'm unsure if other states followed suit. And maybe we have incomplete data as things still need to be logged and confirmed. Meanwhile other countries seem to be in constant downward trajectory, the US is on the climb. This can be answered, partially, by thinking of states as independent countries like the EU does, ""fly over country"" was not hit nearly as hard as high population areas during the initial stages, and maybe it's just their turn. But I feel that there are several layers of lies being fed here. #covid19"

Neutral,@BobmsmartQPM,"Of course we are all nervous. We have been through a lot. We once feared for our very lives... we now have fears of second spikes and unemployment. But the time is right.  We must all live differently; we must stay alert. We must not immediately return to the old normal. Slowly, slowly.  But now the authorities must deal with local or regional flare ups with speed, vim and vigour leaving the rest of us and the economy to recover.  I am now excited to see how well we recover Post Brexit and Post Covid.  We CAN do this.  #Covid19UK"

I wasn’t a diehard democratic, but I felt those were the people I thought stood for we the people, and republicans were greedy, ruining this country. I was one of those people that hated Trump for the last 3 years. I called him a liar, an idiot, amongst many other things. I was convinced he was ruining this country. WOW was I wrong!!! One day I was watching Trumps daily virus briefing and something just clicked. He isn’t dumb or stupid, no he’s just not a politician, he’s just like you or me. He tells it like it is and truly cares about America. It was literally like a fog was lifted and I could see clearly, it was a weird felling. From there the researcher began and it felt like I opened Pandora’s box. Everything I knew and had been told, taught, and shown was bullshit! I can’t watch the nightly news anymore, was an old nightly tradition, the blatant lies and the skewed media reporting makes me sick now. I"
