Negative,@conservativecountrymedia,Is this possible? Can we do this? Has the government destroyed small business? #reopenamerica
Positive,@DessoffAltodoc,"I’m amused by those without any scientific background dismissing concepts like herd immunity. Risk is a part of life. Balancing risk is something we all used to be comfortable with. It seems some are happy relinquishing liberty and freedom for the idea that never leaving the house means no one will die. It’s far more complicated than that. Following logical guidance to stay at home makes sense in many situations but not in others. Unless herd immunity is built we will be in perpetual lockdown. I’m following the rules and enjoy exercise in the fresh air. If you can’t get out even for exercise make sure you’re getting vitamin D. Stay healthy, consider personal and communal risk and strive for Liberty."

Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"And just like that, my Twitter account I’ve been working on every day for over 3 years is now gone. And they wouldn’t even give me a reason. Must have been hitting too close to home on the vaccines. But that’s okay. Nothing can stop what is coming. And nothing will stop me from waking up & continuing to expose these Deep State demons every single day until they are gone from our existence. 🌍🙏🏻💯 #WWG1WGA #DarkToLight #TheGreatAwakening #GodWins #PatriotsAreInControl #TrustThePlan #PanicInDC #Qanon #TheStormIsUponUs #NothingCanStopWhatsComing"

Positive,@Ellisomiedwin,Will someone please join me in purchasing Dianne Feinstein a one way ticket to Tehran? This way she can personally help Iran figure out how to use the mine she allowed Obama to ship over there. She is actually asking President Trump to release Billions to that government to fight Covid19. I say Obama gave them plenty of cash on that midnight covert op they can use to help themselves. Are you out of your fucking mind DiFi? Rhetorical question.
Negative,@Ellisomiedwin,"Thank you to all of the healthcare workers who put their lives on the line each day to care for the sick and dying from this Chinese virus. Not only do they put themselves at risk, but also the families they return to each night. Good bless each one of you."
Negative,@Alhotstart,How can states prevent churches from meeting? Is the Constitution on hold during the Wuhan virus pandemic? Does the separation of church and state not exist? Has marshal law been enacted? Just asking. 😕
Neutral,@ikaika5421,"[Senate Democrats Block $250 Billion in Small Business Relief, Accuse McConnell of a 'Political Stunt'] I've never been the conspiracy type but do you think the Democrats are embellishing and prolonging the Coronavirus thing to completely ruin the economy in hopes of ruining Trump? Trump did not cause this pandemic. China did! The Democrats should be working with our President to help all Americans. Lets not forget thst when this pandemic was first announced Pelosi, Schiff and Schumer were all ""absent"" for some reason for more thsn a week. What were they up too? When the reappeared all they did was resist Trump's stimulus package and delayed it more. The Democrats are not here to help us....they are the enemy within our government as far as I see it."

Neutral,@Ellisomiedwin,"We need to use facts and data to determine when this economy can get started again. “Feelings” and “possibilities” are not good enough to fundamentally transform our rights as citizens of these United States.

Neutral,@CoolBoots,"Far-left actor Alec Baldwin smeared millions of Americans, declaring that anyone intending to vote for President Donald Trump in this year's presidential election must suffer from a mental illness. Alec Baldwin is so blinded by hate his next part may be the coronavirus bat. The biggest advocates of socialism seem to be America's faux-royalty; rich actors, politicians & pundits that feel they're entitled to rule us. They won't suffer under socialism. The rest of us will."
