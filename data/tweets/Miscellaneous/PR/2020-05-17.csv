Neutral,@Ilsleymatthew,"So the BBC are going ahead with their plan to fleece the over 75’s of their pension money. The same BBC that ploughs millions in trying to get a younger audience. The same BBC that quite blatantly sided with the remain element of the Brexit vote. The over 75’s overwhelming voted to leave them EU. The very same over 75’s who are unlikely to stream TV into their homes so they have to have a TV licence. The very same over 75’s who are likely to still be shielding at home in fear of their lives because of Covid-19. So they have to watch TV to get as much information from “the outside” as they can. That (mis) information is being beamed into their homes by the very same BBC in a fashion that will fill them with even more fear. Surely we should be looking out for our elderly not opportunistically robbing them!! I very rarely rant on FB, but I quite simply can’t help myself!! Disgusting!! As soon as they are defunded, the better!! 😡🤬 #defundthebbc"
