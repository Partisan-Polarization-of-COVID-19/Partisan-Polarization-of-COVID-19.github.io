Positive,@Dianapalmer668,"Copied from a friend, Elaine Martin, on Facebook. Remember when we were all angry that the media was only focusing on the hotspots of COVID and instilling fear and we were calling everyone sheep for listening? I hope you are equally angered at the media focusing only on the violent & ugly. Why aren’t they showing the good stuff? Why aren’t they showing communities coming together and finding a better way? They want to insight anger and split sides. Open your eyes...if we demand more responsibility from the media, If we stop giving into them then they will have to stop their crappy reporting. Last night I heard a reporter yell “here comes the action” all hyped up and happy to stir the pot. Let’s work together to stop this...please, for our children, if not for us. My heart can’t take anymore!!! #responsiblereporting #bethechange #bethesolution #demandchange #standtogether #godhelpus #pleasepray"
Neutral,@CoolBoots,"Little Adam Schiff: Over 90,000 Americans have died from COVID-19. Our economy is in a downward spiral to Great Depression-levels. Trump doesn't want the public to focus on his tragic failures. So, to paraphrase Steve Bannon, in order to distract: His people are flooding the zone with excrement. Schiff as usual you suffer from selective memory syndrome. Rather than sitting around playing on your phone while collecting your 174,000+ salary, try helping CA citizens get back to work & out of the food lines. Would have thought you would have refused your salary during this!"
