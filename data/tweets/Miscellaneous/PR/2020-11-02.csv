Negative,@FreeEarthlings,"Dr. #ReinerFuellmich on #PCRtestScandal  The #Covid19Crisis must be renamed a #CoronaScandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages. How dangerous is the virus? What is the significance of a positive #PCRtest? What is the collateral damage with respect to #health and #economy? An international network of lawyers will argue the biggest #TortCase ever - the #CoronaFraudScandal - which has unfolded into probably the greatest #CrimesAgainstHumanity ever committed. #Scientists and #lawyers recognise that as a result of the deliberate panic-mongering and the corona measures enabled by this panic, #democracy is in great danger of being replaced by #FascistTotalitarian models. To make sure that no one will ever again be in a position of such power as to be able to defraud humanity, or to attempt to manipulate us with their corrupt agendas. #SaveTheEconomy #DefendHumanity #EndLockdowns  #MakeLawLawfulAgain  #GetOffOurRights"

As most of you know, due to COVID (and the associated lockdowns and nonsense that have gone along with it), things like singing and choruses have almost entirely been eliminated. From one moment to the next, choirs and choruses across the country have been forced to stop singing together as potential ‚Äúsuper spreaders‚Äù. Despite all of this, we are NOT disheartened and are finding new ways to stay connected and sing. So this Christmas, please consider sending a virtual choir Christmas card to your family and friends at the below link. Not only is it a great way to tell your family that you are thinking of them this Christmas but it will help support my chorus and help it stay alive until we can all get back together again in harmony. In addition, you‚Äôll be supporting a 501-C3 organization and it is fully tax deductible! Win Win all the way around! Thank you all for checking it out and Merry Christmas!"

Neutral,@E4foundation,"Hello friends on Parler! As most of you know, due to COVID (and the associated lockdowns and nonsense that have gone along with it), things like singing and choruses have almost entirely been eliminated. From one moment to the next, choirs and choruses across the country have been forced to stop singing together as potential ‚Äúsuper spreaders‚Äù. Despite all of this, we are NOT disheartened and are finding new ways to stay connected and sing. So this Christmas, please consider sending a virtual choir Christmas card to your family and friends at the below link. Not only is it a great way to tell your family that you are thinking of them this Christmas but it will help support my chorus and help it stay alive until we can all get back together again in harmony. In addition, you‚Äôll be supporting a 501-C3 organization and it is fully tax deductible! Win Win all the way around! Thank you all for checking it out and Merry Christmas!"

Neutral,@buskirk,Here is Fauci confirming that transmission of respiratory viruses by asymptomatic viruses is very rare and is NEVER the driver of outbreaks. So why are public health authorities issuing guidance to treat asymptomatic people as if they are major vectors of viral transmission? That is one of the premises of lockdowns and quarantines.
Neutral,@Apocalypse911,"When you see these politicians and medical experts disregarding the rules that they put in place for us, it is no longer a situation of do as I say, not as I do, for me. It's showing me the reality of how ""deadly"" or not this virus really is or was. They see the ""science"" reports. If they have the comfort in not following the rules, it means the virus actually is overblown for control of the masses. It's a cough. Move on."
Neutral,@blakeRenMan,"* SHOCKING * ‚§µÔ∏è  The Japanese professor of physiology or medicine, Professor Dr Tasuku Honjo, caused a sensation today in the media by saying that the corona virus is not natural. It is manufactured and the virus is completely artificial. I have been working for 4 years in the Wuhan laboratory in China. I know all the staff of this laboratory well. I called them all after the Corona accident. but, all of their phones have been dead for 3 months. It is now understood that all of these laboratory technicians are dead.  I can say this with 100% confidence that Corona is not natural. It did not come from bats. China made it. even after I die, the government can withdraw my Nobel Prize. but China is lying and this truth will one day be revealed to all."
Neutral,@AndrewDevlin,CHILDREN and IMMUNITY  is anyone else concerned what we are doing to our children‚Äôs natural immune systems? I remember researchers years ago blaming the rise of asthma on the cleanliness of the modern world. They believed the reason it was a rich person‚Äôs disease way in the past was because the rest of us played in the dirt and built up a robust immune system as a result. It has become much more evenly spread as of late. Are we doing a similar thing on a grand scale with so much emphasis on killing this virus with ever increasing amounts of soap and antibacterials? What else are we killing? Are we killing the very minor bacteria and viruses that generate an immune response which in turn protects them from more serious pathogens? Only time will tell but I fear this is a disaster in waiting.
Neutral,@AbbyJohnsonOfficial,Be more afraid of sin than you are of a virus.
Neutral,@Hckypatriot,"I agree100%. I refuse to wear a mask and become a sheeple. I will not conform to tyranny.There are too many studies showing masks do not work and that this virus has a 99+% survival rate. My freedom is something I hold dear and will not allow the media to talk me into giving up my rights and freedom by shaming me into wearing a mask, telling me I don't care about others if I don't wear one. Unmask the USA!"
Neutral,@1sgsenchak,"According to the CDC: ‚ÄúCigarette smoking is responsible for more than 480,000 deaths per year in the United States, including more than 41,000 deaths resulting from secondhand smoke exposure. This is about one in five deaths annually, or 1,300 deaths every day. On average, smokers die 10 years earlier than nonsmokers.‚Äù Since government has monetized smoking, they don‚Äôt care if we kill ourselves that way. But a virus used to advance their hold on power? Yes, let‚Äôs exploit the hell out of that. But it‚Äôs all for own own good, right? Government knows best."
Neutral,@FreeEarthlings,"Dr. #ReinerFuellmich on #PCRtestScandal  The #Covid19Crisis must be renamed a #CoronaScandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages. How dangerous is the virus? What is the significance of a positive #PCRtest? What is the collateral damage with respect to #health and #economy? An international network of lawyers will argue the biggest #TortCase ever - the #CoronaFraudScandal - which has unfolded into probably the greatest #CrimesAgainstHumanity ever committed. #Scientists and #lawyers recognise that as a result of the deliberate panic-mongering and the corona measures enabled by this panic, #democracy is in great danger of being replaced by #FascistTotalitarian models. To make sure that no one will ever again be in a position of such power as to be able to defraud humanity, or to attempt to manipulate us with their corrupt agendas. #SaveTheEconomy #DefendHumanity #EndLockdowns  #MakeLawLawfulAgain  #GetOffOurRights"
Neutral,@Godsriddle,"I cried a lot with all the evil hate and death wishes bleeding through on social media. We need to come together. We are Americans. We need to start acting like it. Hate is more deadly and destructive then any virus. It is the driving force that is ripping this country in two. If we hate, we need to self reflect and ask the reason why. The honest answer is usually someone told us lies based on rumor or agenda driven propreganda (main stream media) to enrage us to hate. Hate is not born in us. It is a learned emotion, a choice, as well as a self destructive force that eats away at our soul and even our own phycial health. We need to reverse the hate and fear by researching for facts, finding truth, sharing truth, having compassion, forgiveness and respect for each other. Then we will begin to heal as a nation. United we stand, divided we fall. Those that truly hate us, know this and are working very hard to destroy us from within. Let's not let them. WWG1WGA"
Neutral,@buskirk,"The Biden-Harris Team is already talking about 4-6 weeks of new national lockdowns if they take office.  Remember when it was 2 weeks to slow the spread?  Remember when if you just wore a mask, we wouldn't have to lockdown? (We've had mask mandates for months) Remember when we just needed better treatments and a vaccine? (Regeneron is widely available & multiples vaccines will be available before inauguration day. China has a widely distributed vaccine already) But still...they want to lock you in your house, stop your life, keep you away from church and your loved ones.  No."
