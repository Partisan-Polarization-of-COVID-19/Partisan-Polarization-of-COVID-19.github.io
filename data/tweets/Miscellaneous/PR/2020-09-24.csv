Neutral,@CoolCat4America,That is not 'routine error'. It is quite significant and not acceptable. Just imagine how those incorrect test results temporarily disrupted so many people's lives - causing anxiety and the need to quarantine from family and friends.
Positive,@DianaCollier,This is so funny! I'm going to give everyone I see with a mask on that look.

Neutral,@DBHooey,"You won’t see this reported in the media nationally. It is too much good news. If almost half a million people can gather for an event that spans 10 days with this outcome, it puts their COVID-19 panic porn to rest. The case for mail-in voting would die. We could conduct a safe and secure election as usual. People could go back to work and school without screening tests or masks. And college football would be a go nationwide."

Neutral,@EscapeGoated,Are we going to have to help liberate #Australia? This #Covid19 shit was never about a #virus or protecting people and was always about #tyranny and oppressing society. This is the birth of a #globalist totalitarian world government. Stop complying!

Neutral,@Clinton614,"[WATCH] Italian doctor spills the beans. Covid-19 is not the name of the virus, pay attention, it is rather the name of the International plan for the control and reduction of populations which has been developed over the last decades and launched in 2020. #clinton614"

Neutral,@dantelatko,These are the same people who screamed that the Senate should take up a vote when Obama nominated Merrick Garland but thankfully McConnell had the stones to hold the it until President Trump was elected. These are also the same people who support Pelosi holding the COVID relief package hostage in the House because she wants her pork. Bottom line: ELECTIONS HAVE CONSEQUENCES!
Neutral,@Jglovac,"The CDC comes out & says only 6% of Americans have diedfrom Covid & of those 94% had underlying Illnesses & most of those were people 65 & older! This is a FACT! I have researched it several times! Trump tweeted what the CDC reported & Shitter took it down! Sorry Shitter but it's true! Hospitalizations are DOWN, Intensive care cases are DOWN, & Deaths are DOWN! All FACT not opinion! Positive cases means diddlyscwat!"

Neutral,@DC11546736,"I am struck by the oddness of how Democrats want to crucify Trump for the Covid-19 deaths, but are strangely quiet about the riot deaths. We recognize they renamed the unborn as non human to ramp up the abortion mill to till the fields of research for 💰💰💰💸🤑🤑 I woke up thinking how the left is stinking in their critique of Trumps wife who came in from another Country while wanting a flood of illegals. Maybe it really is about the “character”. Lawlessness benefits those seeking to distract so they attract the kind whose mind can be played. 👎🏼👎🏽👎🏻👎🏾👎🏿"
Neutral,@IVotedTrumpToo,"I like the fact that the CDC admitted to a 94% mistake, and under 10,000 people have actually died of the virus in the U.S. Most of those were in nursing homes. But the MSM keeps reporting over 200,000 have died of the virus."

Neutral,@FaithFamilyFitness,"Okay I have a conspiracy theory for you, and it’s a big one. I decided not to show images of any specific individuals, so you can use your imagination on that. What if... Some rich and powerful people in our country collaborated with the CCP to create the coronavirus in a lab and unleash it on the world? Why? Well the production and distribution of a vaccine has huge financial implications, not to mention the power and control involved in anything else that might be included with it (microchips,etc.) I doubt a reliable technology is currently available to track people with a vaccine, but still my mind goes there. There is definitely enough evil in this world to try and pull it off."
Neutral,@JoeCoolUSA,IF YOU HAVE’NT LOOKED AT MY POST FROM LAST NIGHT I HAVE PROOF FROM THE CDC THAT THEY KNOW THE NUMBERS WERE FUDGED...GO TO THE CDC SITE AND LOOK FOR YOURSELF!
