I feel like in certain instances, in order to beat these scumbags at their own games, without escalating to potential violence, those who don‚Äôt mind wearing them, should. I for one, will not and have only twice. That was only because I was pressured by a customer, and the communist sign on Home Depot‚Äôs door. Thankfully my wife stood strong and didn‚Äôt wear one, which quickly prompted me to take mine off. My mask was a turban I got in Iraq. I had it on my face like the terrorists do.

Neutral,@JosephLemieux,"Here‚Äôs my thought on the Democratic scheme of mail in voting. The Democratic Party has been setting the stage for a total chaotic election. Their doing this by submitting lawsuits for allowing mail in voting because of Covid-19, allowing ballot harvesting, ease on signature verifications, allowing felons and prisoners to vote and working with Democratic governors to eliminate voter ID. What this will do is create so much chaos that we will not know who wins on election night. It will take weeks if not months to sort through the mess they have created; it might even have to go all the way to the SCOTUS. Now, during all this chaos the speaker of the house will assume the role of the president. That‚Äôs right Nancy Pelosi will assume the Presidential role, which could be as early as mid November. Maybe that why Biden has 600 lawyers ready for election night! What's your thoughts!"

Now we see BLM and Anitifa have joined forces with the Democratic leaders to try anything to get Our President out of office. Including this Covid nonsense. Closing States, putting hard working people out of business, and using scare tactics via the media to perpetrate their crime so folks are afraid to go to the polls and vote but rather use mail in ballots that are tampered with.
