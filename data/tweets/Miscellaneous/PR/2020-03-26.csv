Negative,@DashRiprock,"As late as January 14th, China and the W.H.O. were still telling the world that the #ChineseVirus was NOT contagious. üò∑  Chuck Schumer and the DNC were in lockstep with China !  #chinesecoronavirus"
Negative,@AnotherConservatice,"As imperfect as the Senate Republican Coronavirus bill was, at least it wasn't as overtly political as the democrats.  Here is just a list of things the democrats have put in their ""Stimulus bill"": 1) Requiring businesses to permanently pay a $15/hr min wage 2) Early voter and same day voter registration 3) Bail out the post office to the tune of $35 billion  4) $10,000 Student Loan Forgiveness 5) Workers electing 1/3 of their board of Directors 6) Airline carbon emission restrictions  Just to name a few. Call me crazy, but if the point of the stimulus package is to help combat coronavirus and stimulate the economy, shouldn't it actually be about Coronavirus and stimulating the economy?  Watch and echo if you agree! #coronavirus #pelosi #covid19 #chinesevirus"

Neutral,@dem1105,"I love conspiracy theories as much as anyone, but this is different. Something fishy about this virus. I've heard of at least three different lies as to how it was released. You only lie when you want to conseal the truth. I don't have an answer, but something doesn't seem right."

Neutral,@americanrenewable,"‚ÄúRepublicans, who needed 60 votes to move forward on the bill, weren't able to win over any Democrats to proceed, meaning that no aid will flow to the economy ‚Äî including checks to individuals, help for small businesses and bailouts for big corporations ‚Äî until a deal is reached.‚Äù...It‚Äôs almost like they don‚Äôt want free things for people. #democrats #coronavirus #stimulus"
Neutral,@Clinton614,"My daughter is an EMT for the largest ambulance company in the country.  She said they have received no special instructions or taken any precautions for the coronavirus.  I said ""why is that do you think."" She said ""because it is absolutely nothing different than the flu."" In all my life, I have never seen the shelves empty at any grocery store I have ever been to. I can't believe so many people bought into this evil joke, designed to collapse the economy in order to get Trump out of office."
