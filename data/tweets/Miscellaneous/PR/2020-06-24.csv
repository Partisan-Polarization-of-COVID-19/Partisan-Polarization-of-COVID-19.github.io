Positive,@jamesctheman,These politicians really want to defund the police? The cops should call their bluff and stay home for a day. The 99% of good cops who patrol our streets everyday don't deserve to be treated like this.
Neutral,@chrisglenne,"It's infuriating, if we had known that the cure for COVID19 was mindless virtue signalling, we could have all just gone out and yelled and waved some signs around. All these stupid lockdowns and social distancing nonsense could have been avoided."
Neutral,@Clinton614,"This is what armed Trump supporters 'protesting unlawful lockdowns' looked like a couple of weeks ago.  They didn't loot, riot, damage or steal anything, and they were called 'Domestic Terrorists' by the mainstream media!"

Negative,@carpedonktum,"Went to the post office today, and some guy was freaking out that half of us weren't wearing masks. No I didn't record it, I don't make fun of the mentally disabled(that aren't running for President of the Senate)  Fun fact: Once he left, everyone, masked and unmasked said, asshole, almost in unison. Normal people are done with this crap"
Negative,@BrendaRundus,"A 5.8 earthquake hit California today and Chapter 58 in Isaiah came to mind ‚¨áÔ∏è I think about what is going on today and how the Lord is dismantling every fraudulent thing and unmasking every lie, within every sphere. Nothing can be propped up anymore. Whatever is not of Him, it's COMING DOWN. And its done because of God's GREAT LOVE! No more facades. No more props. California- your foundations will be rebuilt! The ""repairers"" of our cities are calling it forth. The ""restorers"" of our cities are being released into our streets. üé∫ Isaiah 58"
Neutral,@gadsdengirl,Could this be more racist? People of color are exempt from wearing masks. Why? Does Portland want them to get sick and die? Do they want to be able to identify black criminals? YES!!

Neutral,@JimLin,"I am sharing this I walked away about 2 weeks into this whole Coronovirus mess. I wasn‚Äôt a diehard democratic, but I felt those were the people I thought stood for we the people, and republicans were greedy, ruining this country. I was one of those people that hated Trump for the last 3 years. I called him a liar, an idiot, amongst many other things. I was convinced he was ruining this country. WOW was I wrong!!! One day I was watching Trumps daily virus briefing and something just clicked. He isn‚Äôt dumb or stupid, no he‚Äôs just not a politician, he‚Äôs just like you or me. He tells it like it is and truly cares about America. It was literally like a fog was lifted and I could see clearly, it was a weird felling. From there the researcher began and it felt like I opened Pandora‚Äôs box. Everything I knew and had been told, taught, and shown was bullshit! I can‚Äôt watch the nightly news anymore, was an old nightly tradition, the blatant lies and the skewed media reporting makes me sick now. I"
