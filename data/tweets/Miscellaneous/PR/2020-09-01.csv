Neutral,@JaxXxY,#pedogate #pedowood #pedophiles #hollywoodpedos   Pedophilia is bad and vaccines can kill.  #vaccinesarepoison #vaccinesaregenocide  Maybe we should vaccinate the pedos then shoot them in the face.
Neutral,@Awzdesertrat,"This is amazing ... New Zealand shut down their borders with the military and took all the the guns... when that wasn’t enough they gave the military the right to invade your home without a warrant to stop Covid. They succeeded in controlling the deaths, but they have painted themselves into a corner and destroyed 1/5 of their gdp and lost their civil rights! Sweden is now done with Covid and has almost no deaths but their population has reached herd immunity. Ironically, New Zealand has nowhere to go economically because if they come out of lockdown the people have no immunity! Consequently, they are in perpetual fear of the virus sneaking into their nation. It seems they have no choice but to reinforce economic suicide in their quest to stave off the inevitable. I predict the virus will eventually infect the population and then everything they did will be in vain!"
Positive,@ANNtheWARDEN,"Epic – Reporter Complains About Social Distancing, POTUS Responds: “It’s a peaceful protest”… Posted by sundance This was a rather funny and epic moment from President Trump’s press conference in Bedminster, New Jersey.   A member of the press pool complains that the room is not following NJ rules on social distancing.  President Trump reminds the reporter that political activity is excluded and this is a form of “peaceful protest”.  lol"
Neutral,@ANNtheWARDEN,"As Death Certificates Finalize, CDC Report Says Whopping 94% COVID Deaths Had ‘Contributing Causes’ The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, to which the world has relied on for COVID-19 direction and guidance for months, released very informative data late last week. Albeit informative, it once again raises confusion as to what message we as the vulnerable, disease spreading population should take away from it.  In its report, the CDC writes “only 6% of deaths have COVID-19 as the only cause mentioned, revealing that 94% of patients have died from coronavirus also had other ‘health conditions and contributing causes.”"

SHOCK REPORT: This Week CDC Quietly Updated COVID-19 Numbers – Only 9,210 Americans Died From COVID-19 Alone – Rest Had Other Other Serious Illnesses So get this straight – based on the recommendation of doctors Fauci and Birx the US shut down the entire economy based on 9,000 American deaths to the China coronavirus."

Neutral,@DeeAnnKH,"Father God, we pray for mercy on the United States of America. Please put an end to the Covid-19 plague and send a Spirit of peace and unity across our land to end the violence in our metro centers. We rebuke those who are leading our nation further astray from Your will. We pray for our brothers and sisters in Christ around the world who are persecuted and oppressed for their faith that You would protect them and fill them with strength of conviction through the Holy Spirit that they not deny Jesus Christ before man out of fear. We praise You and thank You for all that You are and all that You do for us everyday. We pray this in the holy name of Jesus Christ our Savior."
Neutral,@Godsriddle,"What did Ramaphosa say? Interesting statement with what we know. The revelations come just as South Africa - which held the coronavirus back for months with an early, tough, and economically devastating lockdown - now sees infection rates soar nationwide, prompting President Cyril Ramaphosa to warn that ""the storm is upon us"". Fear and fatigue"
