Negative,@Aj4gg,"Delta bans an American hero because he took his mask off and yet by Delta’s own admissions, they allow passengers to take them off quickly to eat and drink. Next time someone rushes to eat then chokes and dies on that flight, should sue them into bankruptcy. You can’t make this shit up. 🤷🏻‍♂️"
Negative,@Georgiagrits,Wonder how many #governors #mayors doing this. @briankempga where’s your investigation #unmasks and open up #smallbusinesses completely
Neutral,@DREIKORN,"This is an interesting test conducted in Europe regarding the effectiveness of those masks that government and many businesses are telling us we must wear (or else). This study (and many others) shows that the typical masks are not only ineffective in stopping aerosols from leaving a mask, the mask can actually pronounce the distribution of the aerosol into the environment... causing greater risk of contamination. The CDC still does not have peer-reviewed science to base their recommendations... yet mandates continue and citizens (also shoppers and passengers) are told to comply or they will be punished. I get doing my part to help the cause, but when science tells us to question mandates, should we simply shut up and comply or speak out.   What say ye?"
Neutral,@dhaglund0223,"Saw a commercial today for face shields. One line jumped out at me. ""Disposable face masks can cost hundreds over the years."" Uh, huh? Years? Yeah, hard pass. Shove your masks and your shields up your liberal, brain dead, fearful sheeple ass."

Neutral,@Flirtyskirt,FB just shut down a group of us on Facebook because we don’t want to wear masks. There were over 44k of us. I am heartbroken. The founder has moved to Parler. Spread the word!
Neutral,@Clinton614,"USA USA USA 🇺🇸🇺🇸 The amount of support we had was overwhelming. First time I've felt normal in months. Nobody had on a mask, just about everyone was armed, hundreds of cars driving by honking, waving and showing their support.... This is how you counter a BLM protest and shut them down! #clinton614"

Positive,@FromNY,SO LISTEN TO THIS INGENUITY; My husband and I go to a winery today. We sit at a table where wine will be sampled. They inform us that because of NY State Covid law we HAVE TO GO OVER TO A COUNTER OURSELF AND PURCHASE FOOD. (I heard complaints about this law in the City Restaurants) So we are trying to figure out how bringing over a little pizza to our table ourself helps stop the spread of covid ??? If anything this “ law” caused us to have exposure to more humans and objects handled by humans !!!!🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️🤷🏻‍♀️ Ps It’s not the carrying the food to the table ourself we are questioning- it’s telling us we HAVE to order food at all! This is the government that will be running a Socialist America if Democrats are elected.

Neutral,@DeplorableMan9,"“This week the CDC quietly updated the Covid number to admit that only 6% of all the 153,504 deaths recorded actually died from Covid. That's 9,210 deaths. Not 153,504. CNN and MSM will not report this. This would cause people not to live in fear!"

Neutral,@Fearzero,"Just an FYI... Channel WGN has started NewsNation, a new news forum of National news. They’ve been on the air 2 days as of last night. So far, I’m impressed. They are trying to make sure they just give the facts, and give news around the Country that isn’t just about the riots, virus or politics. There’s a lot going on that no one even hears on CNN or Fox. Refreshing not to be told how to think. There’s also an app you can download for 24 hr/7 days a week news."
