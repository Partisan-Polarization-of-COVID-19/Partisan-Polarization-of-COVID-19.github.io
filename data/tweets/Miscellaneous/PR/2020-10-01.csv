Negative,@AZCowboyConstitutionalist,No more lockdowns. They do not have the consent of the governed.
Neutral,@carpedonktum,"When I say that we should stop the panic and open back up because 99.8% of people who get the Corona Virus will be fine... it doesn't mean I don't care about the .2% It just means that I realize that a society cannot function when we cripple the economy, put people out of work, and isolate the population based on a .2% chance that someone will have complications. THAT would be uncaring."
