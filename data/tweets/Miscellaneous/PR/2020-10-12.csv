Neutral,@DanSmith,I hope the best for President Trump and the First Lady after their positive test for the Corona Virus. He has lived a healthy life so the fact that he has no underlying conditions makes me hopeful that he will make it through this obstacle. President Trump has been burning the candles at both ends so maybe having the ability to take some time off for a quarantine period will recharge his batteries for the final leg of the campaign before the election. Reading the Twitter comments again speaks to how the Democratic Party and their groupthink ilk have devolved from the party of compassion to the party of pettiness and spite. A lot of people really dislike our president without ever having met him. That means the media's coverage of him is their only vestibule to who he is and the followers of the mainstream media will not consider the extreme bias that is used in their reporting.
Positive,@DFoster569,So a friend of the family stopped in today who was a guard at the local jail and he stated that they let so many prisoners out and they're not charging new prisoners with the crimes they're only at now they're up to 60% capability but he said I got to tell you one of our prisoners is the one who refused to put a mask on these other ones that are creating felonies and was let out is now been replaced with a man who refused to wear a mask he stated it was unconstitutional they put him in jail I'm telling you I've never seen the likes of this

Negative,@jeffthegk,"Thoroughly enjoyed getting to talk to Kaya Jones during this episode of Freedom One-On-One, as she made the case for Donald Trump getting re-elected, especially in light of his focus on cracking down on #HumanTrafficking. Make sure you tune in! #China #ProLife #BlacksForTrump #Communism #Riots #WalkAway #Plandemic #SavetheChildren #KayaJones #Trump #MAGA #Trump2020"
Neutral,@CharlieKeeble,"This election will probably see Donald Trump elected again for four more years. This is not a good year for an election being that it's happening in the midst of a pandemic. But what about potential Republican candidates in 2024?  I have seen some really good and powerful strong woman in America politics on our side. Does anyone have high hopes for them on the presidency and what are your choices? I've got Nikki Haley, Kimberley Guilfoyle, Kristi Noem, and possibly Candace Owens. I've also got high hopes for Madison Cawthorn and Ted Cruz."

Neutral,@DiamondAndSilk,"If the CDC, Scientist & Democrats were so concerned about people dying from COVID-19, then they wouldn't restrict, banned or hide therapeutic medicines that could possibly save someone's life."
Neutral,@Hillig101,The CDC has not isolated the corona virus. They cannot identify it or even find it. The PCR test reacts to any virus. All these supposed positives are from a variety of virus'. So what exactly are they putting in a vaccine to fight a virus they cannot find or even prove it exists.
Neutral,@GrayHairedBiker,The real virus plaguing our nation!

Neutral,@catwilwin,"Toby Rogers PhD, MPP (@uTobian) Tweeted: @amymick333 The Wuhan Institute of Virology used CRISPR for gain-of-function research to make viruses more lethal -- including combining HIV with bat coronaviruses. If SARS-CoV-2 is the result of an accidental or intentional release from the WIV then CRISPR may be directly implicated."
Neutral,@ExposingLibsBS,"Democrats: ‚ÄúThey are lying to us! Trump is on his death bed and they are trying to hide it!‚Äù Also Democrats: ‚ÄúThey are lying to us! Trump doesn‚Äôt have the virus at all, and they are just trying to use it as a political ploy!‚Äù Democrats are sick. Truly, emotionally sick and intellectually crippled carnival goldfish. The lowest common denominator in society. That‚Äôs where our current state of celebrating mediocrity comes from."
