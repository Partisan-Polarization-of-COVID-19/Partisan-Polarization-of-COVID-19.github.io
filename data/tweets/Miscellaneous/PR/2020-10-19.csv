Negative,@Audax1954,"The coronavirus is back in force. Many nations around the world are seeing alarming rises in cases and deaths, totals that in many instances exceed the highs reached in March, April, and May. From the beginning of the pandemic, governments around the world have tried to tame the virus. All have failed, to varying degrees. Whether governments implement draconian lockdowns, modest lockdowns, or no lockdowns at all, the virus has spread. Some countries with harsh lockdowns have fared better; many have fared worse. As some have pointed out, the virus doesn’t seem to care what policies you put in place."
Neutral,@andweknow,10.2.20: TEN days of DARKNESS/Quarantine? RED OCTOBER! Watch here:
Neutral,@buskirk,Here is Fauci confirming that transmission of respiratory viruses by asymptomatic viruses is very rare and is NEVER the driver of outbreaks. So why are public health authorities issuing guidance to treat asymptomatic people as if they are major vectors of viral transmission? That is one of the premises of lockdowns and quarantines.
Neutral,@CarolLyne,"MPs need to be reminded of their legal duty or they will be held to account and could be charged with Malfeasance (wrongdoing or misconduct especially by a public official) resulting in a 10 year prison sentence. Unbalanced Valence, Half-whit Whitty, Bully-boy Boris, Hand on Cock-sorry- Mr Hancock should be arrested for causing more deaths due to the unlawful lockdowns. #plandemic #parler #politics"
Neutral,@11phenomenon,Weird how states big into lockdowns have done nothing about homeless packed into shelters like sardines coming and going infecting others. Everyday a super spreader while others are ironically moved closer to homelessness due to job killing restrictions. And yet the masses are forced to wear unhealthy masks while the homeless super spreader problem and demonstrations/riot super spreaders are ignored.

Neutral,@Audax1954,"Meanwhile, America’s favorite little tyrant is out there letting you know that you’ll need to wear masks and socially distance even after a vaccine that is 95% effective. Think about the numbers involved in that. COVID is still 99.4% survivable, and truly only represents an out-sized danger to those above 75 years of age. Under that age range, you are talking about death rates that either mirror the flu or are less than the flu as you get into children. While a flu vaccine is typically only 40% effective, new vaccines for COVID have shown effectiveness rates of 95%. That means that once the vaccine is deployed, COVID will be far less of a problem than the regular flu. Yet, Fauci still wants you to wear ineffective masks and socially distance for years afterward. For what? Is the goal for no one to ever die again or to manage the disease in a responsible manner?"
Neutral,@1776stonewall,"An Oregon doctor, Dr. Steven LaTulippe, has his medical license revoked simply for questioning the effectiveness of face masks and for comparing Covid-19 to the common cold. . . and most importantly - for attending a Pro-Trump ""Stop The Steal"" rally.

At the Stop the steal rally Dr. LaTulippe said ""I want you to know that I never shut down during the entire COVID season, from the time it was declared till now.

Neutral,@donneal,"“From 1995 to 2005, Giesecke served as state epidemiologist of Sweden. During a one-year sabbatical 1999-2000 he led a group at the World Health Organization working on the revision of the International Health Regulations. After this, he was Chief Scientist at the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control from 2005 to 2014. As of 2020, Giesecke is a member of the Strategic and Technical Advisory Group for Infectious Hazards of the World Health Organization, and also works as an advisor to the Public Health Agency of Sweden during the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden.” You can’t get more authoritative than this gentleman. It would be nice if our leaders—especially our governors—would listen to what he has to say."
Neutral,@GrampaSteve,"The voting process has been rigged with the 80 million mail-in ballots. Trump needs to issue an Executive Order demanding Federal oversight for all counting of mail-in ballots. Each ballot needs to be inspected for legality: Does the signature match that on file? Does the address match the current address of the register voter? Is the voter a U.S. Citizen over 18 and registered in that state? Has the voter cast a ballot in another state?  Any ballots received after November 3rd shall be disallowed.  He issues an Exec Order requiring this Federal oversight. He has the right to do it. We are in the middle of a ""Pandemic"". He can claim obvious fraud. The courts can't stop him. He can just ignore the attempts of Leftist judges. He is the President!"

Neutral,@ANNtheWARDEN,They said no one could locate Cuomo's order re sending COVID-19 patients to Nursing Homes? Here is the order directly responsible for over a third of NY's COVID deaths!

No resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to the NH solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19. ▪NHs are prohibited from requiring a hospitalized resident who is determined medically stable to be tested for COVID-19 prior to admission or readmission.

Neutral,@Audax1954,"According to WXYZ Channel 7 ACTION NEWS… A Michigan Republican member of the state House of Representatives is calling for the legislative body to hold impeachment hearings for Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. Matt Maddock, who represents several cities in western Oakland County, said he and several other legislators are calling “for impeachment hearings for Governor Whitmer.” It comes after Whitmer and Michigan Department of Health and Human Services Director Robert Gordon announced new COVID-19 restrictions on Sunday night. Under the Michigan Constitution, the state House of Representatives does have the power to impeach “civil officers for corrupt conduct in office or for crimes or misdemeanors.”"
Neutral,@CAHarris,Thanks to our friend Jay Bird. Ok. Let me get this right. Antifa is not real. Hunter Biden earned 3.5 mil from the Russian state ran company legally. Trump having covid is a lie but we still hope he dies from it. Women can do what they want with their bodies but the first lady is a whore. Fat shaming is gross but potus is a fat pig. Judging skin color is gross except the orange devil. There was only peaceful protests and riots are a myth. We hate all cops but they better show up if we are in trouble. If we dont vote for biden we are not black. If we disagree with the left and happen to be black we are uncle tom. Syrup is racist but people who hate jews aren't. Sorry.

If those things don't get us, ""West Nile Virus will!"" Or SARS, Bird Flu, Ebola, flesh-eating bacteria or ""killer bees."" Experts told me millions would die on Jan. 1, 2000, because computers couldn't handle the switch from 1999. Machines would fail; planes would crash.
