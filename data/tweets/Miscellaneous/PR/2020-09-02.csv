You know what you’d have? Covid 19.  Party on Wayne. ✌🏼  #COVID19 #shitsfake #hideyokids #DewineSucks #taylorswiftsucks"
Neutral,@Allhooligan,"COVID-19 is real. The leftist response, and the continued shutdown of blue state economies, fear mongering, and exaggeration of deaths (94% not caused by COVID-19) is COVIDIOCY and all the steps leftists take to keep life from returning to normal and prolong the pain, belongs entirely to leftist idiots."
