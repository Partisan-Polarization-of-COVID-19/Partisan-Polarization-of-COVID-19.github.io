Neutral,@10thGenerationAmerican,Thanks for the photo  @DeplorableVet44 . If people didn’t go days without eating they aren’t truly poor. My mom did it for me. The poor of today’s subsidized culture are rich compared to what I was. We had Roaches big enough to stage a rebellion in our home. Where there was a herd immunity to Raid.
Negative,@Goldygirl,"Just saw this in my feed on another site. I doubt this is “temporary”. Just another one of Ige’s casualties. I spoke to a friend that works there, she’s scared, she said if the governor doesn’t open the state soon she’s going to lose her home. He’s crippled the entire economy over a virus with a 98% survival rate. He is determined to run the state of Hawaii in to the ground! Between the governor and the mayor there is no hope! #openhawaiinow #reopenhawaii #hawaiiansfortrump #hawaii #kona #kailua #ikaikamarzo4bigislandmayor #bigisland #fakevirus #scamdemic #covid19hoax #covid19 #mayorkim #ige #freehawaiinow #keeplocalrestaurantsopen #supportsmallbusiness #supportlocalbusiness #lethawaiiwork"
