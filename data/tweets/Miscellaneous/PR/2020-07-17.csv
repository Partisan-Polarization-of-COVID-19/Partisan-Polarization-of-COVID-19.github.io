Positive,@Djc351,"Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear just made an executive order mandating that every Kentuckian must wear a mask when in public, beginning Friday at 5:00 P.M. The mandate requires ""all customers in retail facilities, grocery stores, anywhere indoors where people cannot stay six feet apart from each other, must wear a mask. The same guidelines adhere to outdoor locations as well if people cannot stay six feet apart. If customers in these businesses refuse to wear a mask, businesses can refuse to serve them. Gov. Beshear says the executive order will continue for 30 days and will be re-evaluated after that."" So to those of you going to the beach or lake or any other type of outdoor recreational activities - masks are a requirement for those places as well. Better get a water proof mask. :p LOL. #covid19 #kentucky #governorandybeshear #GovernorBeshear #maskmandate"

Negative,@carpedonktum,"Went to the post office today, and some guy was freaking out that half of us weren't wearing masks. No I didn't record it, I don't make fun of the mentally disabled(that aren't running for President of the Senate)  Fun fact: Once he left, everyone, masked and unmasked said, asshole, almost in unison. Normal people are done with this crap"
Neutral,@AntonioSabatoJr,It‚Äôs my choice to wear or not wear this silly mask and only my choice.
Neutral,@AntonioSabatoJr,Wearing this mask is freaking stupid just like the law makers who are implementing and forcing it down our throats. I am done with BS!

Positive,@DrGosar,"You are the first responder.  In all situations you are the first person there to protect yourself and your family.  If you buy guns learn to use them. Learn the law of self defense. Learn safety. And practice.  You pay taxes to your city and county for protection. The number one job of government is mutual protection. When a middle aged couple has to run outside to handle a mob, society is failing."

Neutral,@DeplorableG,"I just saw a video on YouTube from a doctor in Texas that has 100% success rate in treating COVID-19 and it is the same medication used by Japan, Singapore and Taiwan, who have low death rates. Look for him on YouTube, Dr. Richard Bartlett from Texas. The drug used is Budesonide, a inhaled steroid, used for asthma patients. When used in a nebulizer the patient quickly recovers, even with other illnesses such as cancer. Y‚Äôall check it out! He states that President Trump has just been informed of this treatment, and Ted Cruz was the person to inform the President."
Neutral,@Avery2020,"CUOMO'S EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS A DEATH SENTENCE FOR SEVERAL THOUSAND NYC ELDERLY Governor Andrew Cuomo, by his executive order of last March, killed thousands of precious elderly in New York City. His attempt to blame President Trump for covid-19 deaths in NYC, especially where Cuomo failed to properly use the hospital set up in the Javits Center and on the USS comfort, is the most obscene attempt to avoid responsibility for a deadly decision that I have ever seen a politician make. He should be ashamed and apologize to the families of those he killed. COPY OF CUOMO'S ORDER ATTACHED BELOW"
