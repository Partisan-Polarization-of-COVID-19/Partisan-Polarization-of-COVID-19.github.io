Negative,@IDTX,"Responding to a message on Trump’s “Failure”:  Of those 180K dead, how many came from Jersey, NY, and other blue states where the nursing home policies killed tens of thousands of elderly citizens needlessly?  Trump shut down international Travel from China in January, back when Pelosi went in the news with no mask & was telling everyone to not worry and come down to China town! It’s just a stunt!  Trump promoted HCQ back in March when tests showed efficacy, and now, 6 months later, countries who use it are reporting great results.  There were more manufacturing jobs created under Trump The Black unemployment dropped to lowest levels in decades The First Steps Act released thousands of wrongly imprisoned minorities and started them in rehab & trade training.  Qualified Opportunity Zones have sent billions of private dollars to underserved and impoverished areas of the country to develop and help them come out of the cycle.  He’s actually fulfilling campaign promises #trump2020"
Negative,@ACnoLibzone,Democrats and those that vote for them are fools! Shut downs don't work and this is all about control! Take off your mask and start acting like Americans!!  @Name Hidden   @Name Hidden
Negative,@AustinIsAwake,Stop wearing masks! The people have the power. #thepeoplehavethepower
Neutral,@JakeStelmach,"Why don’t we all go to our local stores at least once without a mask and see what happens (unless you’re actually sick, then wear one). I did today in California and was not admonished by anyone. #nomaskchallenege"
Neutral,@JamesOtis76,"That’s about stupid, especially when the CDC has already told us that 75% of positive cases wore their mask all the time. This is about control. Not happening anyhow considering Biden’s media win means absolutely nothing. Biden is the President elect just as much as anyone is"
Neutral,@Eyeballs,"Where was all this enthusiasm at the voting booths? For months the Left complained and whined about how unsafe it was to vote in person, dispite social distancing, mask requirements and safety protocols. Yet when the media declares Biden victorious, magically, all that fear evaporates. Mail in ballots were never necessary. In fact, they were a coup to steal the Presidency. This is proof of that."
Neutral,@DoingRight1,US veteran quits his job after being told he can’t wear an American flag as a mask.

Neutral,@Eyeballs,"Thousands of people are now in the streets celebrating Biden's ""victory""...interesting. They shunned him during his campaign rallies and mailed in their votes citing fear of spreading Covid...now it's all of a sudden Covid is a non issue? Magic, I say. What's more is the chastising claims that Republicans were spreading the virus by attending Trump rallies, protests and participating in record breaking boat parades. A Democratic sham unfolding right before our eyes. 🧐"
Neutral,@DewsNewz,Facebook is Censoring CDC data showing low COVID-19 Death Rate  Article attached
Neutral,@DeplorableKlee,"""CoVID has taken this year... just since the outbreak, has taken more than 100 years.. Look, the lives, when you think about it, more lives!” - Joe, the gaffe machine Biden! Come on man... who would vote for this senile mess???"
Neutral,@IDTX,Department of Justice Requesting Data From Governors of States that Issued COVID-19 Orders that May Have Resulted in Deaths of Elderly Nursing Home Residents | OPA | Department of Justice Read through this... pretty good stats.
Neutral,@Fearless45,#Democrats are the greatest threat to your life and liberty. #Liberalism is a deadly disease much worse than Covid-19 or any plague in history. Practice your 2nd Amendment rights. You may need that practice soon. #Democrats are why #ICarry #2A #KAG2020 Fearless45.com #Fearless45
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"There is no “Great Awakening” in the Bible. But there is a great deception that takes place. The Bible tells us the Beast & the Antichrist will eventually rule the entire earth for a short time. This matches up to the New World Order that has been openly in the works for centuries. COVID-19 was a worldwide false flag that has been conditioning people for what is to come. I know that doesn’t sound pleasant, but there is good news. Jesus died to save your soul. Call on him. 🙏🏻"
Neutral,@IDTX,"Rioters leave a wake of destruction worse than corona virus for these business owners and their families/employees.  Senseless death, destruction, and anger. Those who don’t condemn the riots/Antifa/BLM and support or encourage their continuation: they are the true enemies of the state Ms Pelosi."
Neutral,@DigitalSwolljer,"FALSE. THIS IS FAKE NEWS! These figures are off by 94%! #SixPercent U.S. CDC reports 182,622 deaths from coronavirus | Article [AMP] | Reuters"
