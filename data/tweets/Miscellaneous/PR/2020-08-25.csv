Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"An apartment complex in Ventura County, CA is locking their residents inside the building until all of them are tested for Covid. I called the number, was put on hold, & then eventually forwarded to voicemail. This is the dangerous slope we‚Äôve been talking about - & it‚Äôs exactly what the Cabal wants. They don‚Äôt even have to mandate laws or draft legislation when landlords, banks, businesses, etc. will go along with the agenda & require this out of their tenants /customers. And what happens if 1 child tests positive in a public school setting? Will they lockdown that entire school until every kid is forcefully tested then shipped to a ‚Äúquarantine facility‚Äù if positive? This is called tyranny & it never ends up well for us citizens. It‚Äôs time to wake up & fight for our God-given rights. #WWG1WGA"
Positive,@DocGarcia1429,"Southwest Airlines no longer allows passengers with medical conditions, who are unable to safely wear face masks, to fly in their planes. This is the last time I‚Äôll fly on this fuckin‚Äô commie ass airline. #fucksouthwest"
Neutral,@DrinkerOfLiberalTears53,Liberals Are Always Taking Our Rights Away. First They Take Our Guns So We Can't Fight Back Against The Tyranny Imposed By Fauci Then They Make Us Wear Mask! Fellow Trump Supporters Do This Country A Favor And Shoot Mask-Wearing Communists. The Lord Jesus Will Be Proud.

Neutral,@ajaxzimm,This is the only news organization who seem to want to do investigative work. Bravo to them. Where is MSM?... They are still talking #goya From the article. it‚Äôs 100‚Ä¶it doesn‚Äôt make any difference if it's 99 -- but the fact that the individual didn‚Äôt die from COVID-19‚Ä¶died in the crash. But you could actually argue that it could have been the COVID-19 that caused him to crash. I don‚Äôt know the conclusion of that one.‚Äù
Neutral,@ajaxzimm,"There are a lot of events that happened in #NYC over the past decades that we should #neverforget. 9/11 was the latest and now Gov. Cuomo's executive order putting covid patients into nursing homes, causing the deaths of 6,000+ people. Never forget that! The media hates you."

Neutral,@GuymaddenPresidentElect,"Just so we are all clear, so far this year there has been over 80 million new births, and 37 million deaths, smack bang in the middle of a worldwide epidemic.!! We have increased the population by 43 million, humanity is in no way doomed by this fabricated virus."

Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"This coronavirus is the strangest virus I‚Äôve ever heard of. It‚Äôs very dangerous in the way it spreads. It is so mysterious the way it lurks in schools, but then dies at Home Depot. It can wreak havoc in churches; praying people are exceptionally vulnerable! Although it‚Äôs mind-boggling how it vanishes when people stand close together holding signs, destroying businesses, homes, property, monuments, etc. Yet, standing to watch a marathon or a concert triggers its wrath. It is sneaky. It can spread when buying clothes at Kohl‚Äôs but not at Target. It is non-alcoholic. It can‚Äôt spread when you are buying beer. It lives for two days on Amazon boxes, you must wait 48 hours to touch them but it can‚Äôt survive on Dunkin Donuts coffee cups, so enjoying a hot cup of joe is safe.....

Neutral,@johnbohler,"Unfortunately, Herman Cain has just passed due to Coronavirus. I have followed Cain for quite some time and he was instrumental in forming my politics during the 2012 election. He was the first Presidential candidate I eagerly supported. I remember many an afternoon reading up on and defending his policy positions, such as his famous 9-9-9 tax plan. He would have made a great president.  More recently, he was an active voice on talk radio. His optimism was absolutely contagious. He will greatly be missed. #hermancain #parler"
