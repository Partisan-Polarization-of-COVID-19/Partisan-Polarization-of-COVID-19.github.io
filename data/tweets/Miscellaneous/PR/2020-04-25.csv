Neutral,@Incubus,"The #WHO is a #Chinese propaganda engine steaming down the rails spewing huge black clouds of aberrant and #malicious, #communist bullshit. ""Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus should be held accountable for recklessly managing this deadly pandemic. Tedros turned a blind eye to what happened in Wuhan and the rest of China and, after meeting with Xi in January, has helped China to play down the severity, prevalence and scope of the COVID-19 outbreak.""-The Hill"
Neutral,@Clifffield,"I was feeling ill. I have several risk factors that would make a COVID infection possibly fatal. I have a cough, runny nose and body aches. I did not panic. I called my doctor, a great guy. They took information over the phone then, later, he called me back on FaceTime. He asked me more questions. I don’t have COVID symptoms. That alone made me feel better. I have bronchitis. He prescribed an antibiotic. I went to my pharmacy and they brought it to my truck. MY POINT. If you are feeling symptoms of illness please don’t panic. Call your doctor, an ER or the CDC website but don’t panic. Especially if you’ve been staying home. Panic speeds your metabolism which causes infections to spread faster. God bless you all. And if you are not sick, he already has."
