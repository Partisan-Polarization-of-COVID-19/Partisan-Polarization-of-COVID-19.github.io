Positive,@jamesctheman,I'm really sick of hearing every commercial on every piece of media I use telling me to stay home.  Social distance. Wash my hands.  Wear a mask.  I'm sick of hearing that we're alone together.  Seriously?  There's no together.  They've spent the last 3 years splitting us apart and now you want me to love they neighbor?  Fuck you.

Neutral,@Deplorabus,"I agree with you 100% Meri.  1. He never cleaned out the Obama scum that infects all of our government agencies today.....why not ? 2. He appoints Sessions, Barr, & Wray.

Neutral,@jamesctheman,"Trump is right in the middle of a full scale war against the swamp & a Chinese pandemic.  Grennell is racking up victories. The country is testing 300,000 people a day.  Trump is winning. People continually doubt him. They keep predicting his demise.  They don't even realize they're retreating."

Neutral,@Deplorabus,"AN OBSERVATION: Arizona has 39,000 auto accident deaths per year. So, this past 3 months that would be 9,750 deaths in auto accidents.  By comparison, in the same 3 months there were ( as of yesterday )  A whopping 229 deaths due to the ‚Äúpissant virus‚Äù C-19. LMAO üëªüëª LOOKS LIKE WE NEED ANOTHER ASININE ORDER FROM THE ASININE GOVERNOR TO REQUIRE ALL CITIZENS TO RELINQUISH THEIR DRIVER‚ÄôS LICENSES. WALKING AND BIKING ONLY PERMITTED.  NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT YOU WOULD FIND SIMILAR COMPARISONS IN ALL 50 STATES. WE HAVE PISSANT GOVERNORS ISSUING PISSANT ORDERS FOR A PISSANT VIRUS ( because they are ignorant ) ! ONLY FOOLS DESTROY THEMSELVES !!!!üë∫üë∫"
Neutral,@jamesctheman,All in this together?  Most people are scared to leave their home.  Socially distant?  Have you seen the generations the internet is raising.  Our children are the definition of socially distant.  What should you fear more? The coronavirus or the Democrats taking power?
