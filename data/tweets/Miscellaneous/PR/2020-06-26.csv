Wtf is that?? Just turned to Fox & Sharpton isn‚Äôt eulogizing shit, he‚Äôs talking about racism as usual. The more shit like this I see the more I believe the conspiracy theories.

Positive,@JohnVipe,"Just so we‚Äôre all clear. The ‚Äúpolling‚Äù data against Trump doesn‚Äôt signify a gosh darn thing.  It‚Äôs bullshit. No one is excited for Biden or ‚Äúgoing back to normal.‚Äù The senior citizens of this country decide the elections still, generally speaking and they want a nice quiet life, not a rowdy one as indicated by the way the left is portrayed. Furthermore, Biden debates and Trump wins- Biden chooses not to debate (his reason will be ‚Äútrump won‚Äôt wear a mask.‚Äù) then he looks even weaker. #MAGA brothers and sisters, this is false. The black community doesn‚Äôt hate Trump- Al Sharpton and the left don‚Äôt speak on behalf of all blacks, and I just don‚Äôt buy the collective hate. Anyway, have a good night folks."

Loving each other and helping those in distress."
