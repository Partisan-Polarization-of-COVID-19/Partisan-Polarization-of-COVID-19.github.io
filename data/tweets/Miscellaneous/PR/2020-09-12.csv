Positive,@DashRiprock,"Many of the same people who are demanding that I wear a mask to keep them healthy, will eat a Bacon Double Cheeseburger & Fries for lunch today. üò∑üçîüçü"
Positive,@HopeSprings,"Governor Kristi Noem (R-SD) has been the only Governor in America that has gotten it right. Not only has she left wearing a mask up to the individual, she never shut her state down, or even the buinesses in her state. She even stands at the South Dakota State Captiol, everyday, no matter the weather, and prays over her state, and then walks the halls of the South Dakota state capitol and prays over every legislator's office, and elected official, that God will guide them and help them make the right desicions. South Dakota is in the best shape and condition than any other state in our nation. Governor Noem is a true constitutionalist! She is an example and an inspiration to us all! Copied. Cause it should be said, known and shared all across this country that Gov. Noem is exactly the kind of leader every politician should strive to be!!"
Negative,@AlDubya,Without face we don't exist as independent beings. The child looks in the mirror between the ages of two and three and is discovered as an independent being. The mask is the beginning of deleting individuality. #masksareforslaves #takeoffthemasks #nomasks #saynotomasks
Neutral,@Graniaom,"More positive evidence for in person voting :  At the DNC convention (East, Wilmington DE) Everyone must get a Covid test provided on site to be inside the secure perimeter. All very orderly, waiting in line, six feet apart, wearing masks and being tested. You know, lined up like people casting their vote :)"
Negative,@DomfreedomkeeperSYD,"I would rather go down in history as a moron and be right than be forced into doing something so evil as being told I must get vaccinated to buy groceries, purchase goods and drive a car.

Negative,@HubLife,California Patriots have had enough of the Shamdemic.
Negative,@DewsNewz,This should be everyone‚Äôs ringtone. COVID-19 is planned takeover of humanity. #COVIDHoax
Negative,@EliJA,Plandemic II: indoctrination. Watch and be warned!
Negative,@crashtestmommy,"Trump brokered a potential deal bringing peace to the Middle East for the first time in THOUSANDS of years, but the left continue to focus on this plandemic. üôÑ"
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,The CDC has now stated that only 9000 people have died from Covid without any underlying causes. This ‚Äúpandemic‚Äù has killed only .00001% of the US population. And the virus now has a survival rate of 99.99%. So why isn‚Äôt Trump relaying this crucial information to the public? Why is he still working with Fauci? And why is he using the military to roll out an untested vaccine? Think.
Neutral,@JimJordan,"Democrats have politicized: -#COVID„Éº19  -Going to church -Going to school -Going to work -Defending your home -College football -And now, the post office The Left should stop harassing Americans who just want to live their lives."
Neutral,@DewsNewz,Just when thought the COVID-19 BS could not pile any higher.
Neutral,@georgiapeach1,I'm rethinking my career choice! COVID is not a hoax! I'm so tired of hearing it!  People are selfish!

Neutral,@AmericanCaeser,"WHY NOT SPREAD THE ELECTION OVER TWO DAYS? ODD HOUSE NUMBERS ON ONE DAY, EVEN HOUSE NUMBERS ON THE NEXT DAY. THEN THEY CANT COMPLAIN ABOUT THE COVID RISK. HALF THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE ARRIVE TO VOTE ON EACH DAY."

Neutral,@BrianParke,"I believe we are entering another period of opportunity within the markets. I had recommended to those around me to sell the market / buy inverse ETFs last DEC/JAN, the buy market ETFs after the COVID crash mid-March. Over the past two weeks again I have been recommending individuals consider selling the market again (or exiting into cash), and then be prepared to possibly buy the market again after a significant decline (presuming it‚Äôs possible to return to normal). My presumption is Q4 will bring about chaos and uncertainty (though my hope is it will not). If you have no experience in the markets please see the info-graphic below for a simple way to play both booms and busts. (Please remember it‚Äôs gambling until you can properly gauge risk, reward, and probability)."
Neutral,@BigTdog,So it's not really about a virus then???? Daily Mail: Queensland health chief officer admits REAL reason A-listers are allowed to bypass border closure.
Neutral,@ChristianEl,"Can‚Äôt find a post from any of the heavy hitters on Parler about the President misleading the American people about a deadly virus for the past 9 months.  Guess I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised... And for all you who exclusively get your ‚Äúnews‚Äù from those propaganda outlets, this should clearly tell you that you‚Äôre not getting truthful information.  Sad state of affairs for this once great country."
Neutral,@ChristianEl,Context: The University of Alabama had 530 confirmed new cases of coronavirus yesterday.  That‚Äôs more than most countries around the world had yesterday.
Neutral,@CliffC,"This coronavirus scare is our generations ‚ÄúWar of the Worlds‚Äù broadcast, on a much greater scale. They now know they can control us all, we have been defeated, wave your white flags in the air. The politicians, the elite, and the media machine duped us all. They control the military and the police; yes, they fell for it too. Here we all sit, compliant. We have given up our rights, we have set the precedent. We lost. We lost because we fear going to jail. We lost because we wanted to be good people and good Americans. We lost because we forgot what this nation was founded upon.  The tyranny is evident. Our dictators are the politicians, the media, social media, tech giants, and the rich. They conspired and set in motion the takeover of a nation without firing a shot; and won. Mere rantings of an insomniac...maybe."
Neutral,@carpedonktum,"""False Claim"" is a funny way of spelling ""Data taken directly from the CDC website"""
