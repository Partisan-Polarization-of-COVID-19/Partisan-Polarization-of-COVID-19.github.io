Neutral,@Deh0414,The single biggest proof that lockdowns and masks are not a strategy and do not work other than creating more death and misery
Neutral,@Deh0414,Half of all black workers in MN are out of work thanks to lockdowns and probably also the rioting. What is so hard for Republicans to provide a bold contrast?
Positive,@Cre8tiv62,"Today at Sams Club i was told at checkout that i need to use curbside pick up because i didnt wear a mask. In all honesty i am medically exempt, so says the exceptions to the rule from our state Gov. So even though my condition falls under the ADA, i cant shop inside. I wont be bullied. I wont wear a mask. I will breathe the virus laden air because you cant run and hide from anything microscopic. Masks keep you from building your immune system, and i think that’s what the ignorant elected officials want.  #votetrump2020  #vote LuciferLeftOUT"

Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"This coronavirus is the strangest virus I’ve ever heard of. It’s very dangerous in the way it spreads. It is so mysterious the way it lurks in schools, but then dies at Home Depot. It can wreak havoc in churches; praying people are exceptionally vulnerable! Although it’s mind-boggling how it vanishes when people stand close together holding signs, destroying businesses, homes, property, monuments, etc. Yet, standing to watch a marathon or a concert triggers its wrath. It is sneaky. It can spread when buying clothes at Kohl’s but not at Target. It is non-alcoholic. It can’t spread when you are buying beer. It lives for two days on Amazon boxes, you must wait 48 hours to touch them but it can’t survive on Dunkin Donuts coffee cups, so enjoying a hot cup of joe is safe.....
