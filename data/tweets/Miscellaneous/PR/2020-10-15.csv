I wish them a speedy recovery, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll look after each other as they get though quarantine and this difficult time! However, looking through social media and seeing death wishes and threats is despicable. You may not like the man, or don‚Äôt agree with everything they say but at the end of the day they‚Äôre still human and important people in the world. Just like when Boris Johnson had the virus, they wished death on him even in his hospital bed.  Threats are coming from the other end of politics, left wing supporters and voters. At least be the better people and not stoop so low.

Neutral,@DannALbenDalton,"Hey Maskachists, if following the rules was what this was about, the Colorado state Congress would have legislated against not wearing a facemask. A dictatorial mandate is not a ""law"". It's like gun laws, do they obey the ""rules"" , the Constitution? It is our RIGHT to act normal. The burden of proof is supposed to be the government responsibility, but that is to prove violation of LAW, say it with me, LAW. Our Governor was not elected to make law, but our legislators were. If charged with spreading a virus, it would have to be proved that one did it. Basically, people are charged with not pretending that they are guilty of carrying a virus."
Positive,@DannALbenDalton,"The whole idea of reducing the spread for the risk of the spread questions any intellectual honesty one may have. Contact with the virus is how vaccines work. Contact with the virus is also how herd immunity works. The main difference lies in the delivery system that delivers the virus to the human beings. The natural delivery system of the virus to the human does not involve catalysts. It's also void of human efforts, profit motives, science as mandated human knowledge. Counterintuitive it has always been to think this delivery system should involve things other than the proven respiratory system."

Negative,@Hleshley,"Would it be safe to assume that the KungFlu will not make a showing at the coming endless parade of State Sanctioned funeral pomp and glory for the Justice? Yes, she was a so called Giant in history. Yes, she helped steer the SC into a body that legislates from the bench( a horrible situation) and yes she was a nice lady. These facts, I‚Äôm guessing, will ensure the Communist/Progressive/Socialist/Democrat party attendees will be virus free. My family lost the father of our closest friends. My mother and the deceased became friends in the second grade, (she‚Äôs 86) and we knew which ever house you were in, those parents were your parents. To date, his wife and children have not been allowed to lay him to rest. So while we grieve for this ‚ÄúGreat lady‚Äù remember the tens of thousands who were not allowed to say goodbye. If only we‚Äôd know party affiliations, wealth and power, meant immunity from the KungFlu."
