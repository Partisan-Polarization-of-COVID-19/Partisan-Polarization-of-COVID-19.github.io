Neutral,@Barbiergiselle,"Germany and Austria calling out COVID for what it is, a hoax. More investigation is necessary to impose lock down restrictions. There is something very wrong about this. WAKE UP"
Neutral,@Barbiergiselle,This video shows medical doctors in Austria and Germany questioning the virus and unnecessary restrictions for lock down around the world. Things don't make sense and it looks as the virus is another from of cold. Find this video in English. This virus is a hoax and we must discover together the reason for restrictions on citizens. Something more sinister is going on. WAKE UP!
Positive,@Hearronsnest,If masks work why didnt they give them to prisoners instead of releasing them???
Positive,@CanadaJill,Mask wearing just became mandatory in my community. Not sure how I feel about this. The cases in my region are low and mostly in care homes for the elderly. Any other Canadians out there have mandatory mask bylaws where they live?
Positive,@Conniedlopes,Britain 'WILL consider telling people to wear face masks in public'
Negative,@anitakmiller,"‘Print this article and hand it to frightened mask wearers who have believed the alarmist media, politicians and Technocrats in white coats.

Negative,@blaze99,"So, I think it is time for Gov DeSantis to open back up and take the masks off since the positive tests were made up."
Negative,@Derek,Dr. Fauci was caught by Americas Voice News for taking his mask off when the hearing was over. You can’t make this up.

Neutral,@GhostRaven,"I watch Dan Bongino every morning, a great way to start my day is a day started with Truth. I love a place I know I can turn to that I can trust. Today was great. I don't blame you at all #dbongino this whole mask thing is BS in the fact that they think we cannot use our own judgement. I think at my age (older than Dirt accourding to my grown kids) I can make up my mind when a mask is warrented. I take care of a Cancer patient and would never endanger her. I take percausions around others but will not be controlled by a society who wants to become a member of the communist controlled China arm. Day by day I see one freedom after another being taken away. If the dems get their way we will be a sister country of the CCP. I will fight that to my last breath. I feel sorry for the everyday chinese people who have to live under the CCP for they have no choice. If they had the means they would fight and we should fight to make sure we keep our independence."

Neutral,@Hearronsnest,Do osha standards still exist? My husband is suffering from a terrible headache. The mask he is forced to wear is starving his brain of oxygen.
Neutral,@JoeyTwoCups,"According to the CDC over 2,300 people die of heart disease each day. Also, according to the CDC, 370 people died from the #Coronavirus today. It’s far more about what you put in you then what you put on you. #masks"

Neutral,@DD4UK,Another ‘good news’ day. Antibody levels in recovered COVID-19 patients decline quickly. Tell me again about that herd immunity...

Negative,@Jamesh0ppe,"Decide yourself if you want to believe this recommendation from the WHO. Remember at the start of this, THEY said the #ChinaVirus wasn't that serious."
Neutral,@bcundiff,I’m not a professional but color me curious how good polling is in the middle of a pandemic.
Neutral,@JimLin,"I just got off of the John's Hopkins University Covid-19 web site. You know, the source of information everybody uses when they claim all their shit is valid and MUST be believed. Ok, so as of TODAY, JHU reports the Global total of confirmed cases is 12,107,985 (twelve MILLION, ONE HUNDRED SEVEN THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE) and the total deaths is 550,901 (Five hundred fifty thousand, nine hundred and one). For all you none math geeks, that equates to little over a whopping 0.04 percent! (That's ZERO POINT ZERO FOUR !)  You got that? Read it again, ZERO POINT ZERO FOUR PERCENT!!  That is NOT a global ""pandemic"" bent on wiping out humanity! It is a bothersome bug that close to 98 or 99% of the population will recover from! It's NOT SMALL POX!! JESUS CHRIST! Shout this from the rooftops and force this to end! Less than 5% of our total global population has died. Does that piddly ass death rate justify the complete destruction of our lives and economy and freedom ????  IT! DOES NOT"

Neutral,@Bamransom,"John Ransom- Writer, American Wire: “What’s really happening is that the media and Democrats often carry the water of Chinese Communists who make similar arguments as progressives in America. In this case, it’s a matter of saying that anything that questions Chinese culpability for the COVID-19 disaster is by definition ‘racist.’”"
Neutral,@Evalee8262,"It occurred to me more than once, and i hate to think this could possibly be true, but what if they are trying to kill off seniors who they think will be Trump voters. Cuomo seems to have absolutely no regret for putting covid positive people into nursing homes, even when that boat was there and that other place was set up AT TAXPAYERS EXPENSE FOR NOTHING. I feel like we are actually living in all the apocalyptic books/movies rolled into one: Logan’s Run, Fahrenheit 451, Brave New World, 1984...."

Neutral,@GavinMcInnes,The rioting started 3.5 weeks ago. The longest it takes to see symptoms is 2 weeks. Where’s the spike? This accidental global experiment just proved Corona was nothing more than a bad flu season.
Neutral,@DD4UK,"Climate, racism, policing, Corona.... everything becomes a target for agitators & bad actors whose only intention is collapse of capitalism & installation of pernicious, Marxist, identity-based ideology. Everything becomes a Trojan Horse. Why? Because democracy stops them. They can’t be honest because the electorate, in general, will always reject their ideology. Revising or deleting history helps these bad actors by controlling narratives, instilling fear in dissenters & cementing group-think. Social media perhaps gives a distorted view of the situation, but I don’t think I’ve ever been more worried for the future of my child.  How do we equip them to reject this? A silent majority could soon become a minority."

Neutral,@DystopianEarth,"What did I say? What did I say? I said... they'll probably say that Ghislaine Maxwell contracted Coronavirus while in jail.
