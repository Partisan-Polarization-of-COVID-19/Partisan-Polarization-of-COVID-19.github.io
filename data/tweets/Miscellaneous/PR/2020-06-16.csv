Neutral,@JEFFKO66,"THIS IS WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO WEAR THE MASK PEOPLE. **Posted by a fb friend** My daughter. 19 yrs old. Healthy. Frontline worker at a huge grocery store chain. Started feeling sick about two weeks ago. Side and back pain. Nausea.. Chest pain. Primary doc sent her for chest x-ray.. Something ""lit up"" on right side. Sent for MRI. Cat scan. Ultra sound of back and abdomen areas..NOTHING.. While at work was unable to breathe. Chest pain. Rushed to e.r. quarantined. Tested for covid. Young. By herself because no one can be with her. Turns out its pleurisy.. An inflection of the outside of the lining of the lungs. They basically tell her.. It's because she has been wearing a mask for over 8 hours a day 5-6 days a week. Breathing in her own bacteria. Carbon dioxide.. Caused an infection. And now she is in severe pain. Has to be off work with no pay.. But you wont see that on social media! She's 19. Healthy. And now is bed bound and struggling to breathe. Antibiotics. Steroids. Breath"

Positive,@asfpxl,On another note I guess social distancing during these violent protests are legal and acceptable but mom and pop stores struggling to survive still can't open for business because of fear of a spread of covid19; again hypocrisy.

Neutral,@JEFFKO66,"As America burns while still recovering from a pandemic they created, China exerts its control over Hong Kong with limited fanfare. Not a surprise..All part of China's plan to be THE global superpower. In the end it won't work -- we'll recover, we are America -- but in many ways its like what the Islamic extremists did on 9/11 - i.e. severely weaken the U.S near and long-term. The fact that we are now burning down our own neighborhoods in the middle of crisis is something China couldn't have planned but is certainly enjoying (check their Twitter feed). Maybe we can be smarter? Our democracy, our good nature and our bleeding heart media make it impossible for us to compete with evil but we MUST persevere, understand evil intentions when its obvious, and hold nations and people accountable, and that includes those of our own people who choose criminal behavior that undermines our country."
