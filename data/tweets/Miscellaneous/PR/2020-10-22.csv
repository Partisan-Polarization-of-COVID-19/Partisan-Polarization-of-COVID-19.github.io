Neutral,@Chiquipolo,"If I had the chance to ask questions in a Town Hall, I would have liked to ask the following: For POTUS Trump: 1. Since you get blamed for every person who has lost his/her life due to Covid: a. Do you regret following Dr. Fauci's and Dr. Birx's advice in how to handle the Covid situation? b. Do you regret giving full authority to the governors of each state to handle the situation as they deemed best? For Biden: 1. Can you explain this idea of government-owned land that farmers get to use to plant the crops the government tells them to? 2. Given that NY has the highest number of Covid deaths by far, how do you rate Gov. Cuomo's handling of the situation? 3. Can you explain your plan for economic recovery and how it differs from President Trump's plan?"
