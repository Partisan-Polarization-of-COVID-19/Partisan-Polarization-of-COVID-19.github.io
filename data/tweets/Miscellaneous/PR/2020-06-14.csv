Neutral,@Demfools,"A plane has five  passengers on board: Donald Trump, a Pastor,  Dr. Anthony Fauci,  Nancy Pelosi, and a  ten year old school girl.  The plane is about to crash and there are only four parachutes. Dr Fauci, said “I need one,  I have to help develop a cure for the global health crisis  that is COVID19!”  He straps on a parachute  and jumps. The Pastor said “I need one,  I have to help spiritually guide people through the global health crisisthat is COVID19!”  He takes one and jumps. Pelosi said ‘‘I need one, I’m the smartest woman in the United States.” She takes one and jumps. President Trump pauses for a moment and then turns to the 10-year-old. After a deep sigh, he says tenderly, ""You can have the last parachute. I've lived my life,  yours is only starting"".  The child replies,  ""Don’t worry, there are  two parachutes left.  The smartest woman in  the United States took  my school backpack. 😂😂😂🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️😂😂😂"
