Positive,@DaveRPh,"Time to ditch the masks.   Why are people still wearing masks? Their is no scientific reason to do so.  The reasons are: 1. People want to be part of the 'group' and look 'clinical'.  2. Crafters are all in with the newest 'mask making' projects. 3. People know they don't work but are afraid to stand up for their Constitutional rights. 4. There is massive intimidation coming from the Democrats, who are using masks as the first step in obedience training.  5. People are making $ millions from masks and they control the false narrative that masks work. If masks really stop the spread of COVID you would hear TV commercials making this claim...they don't."
