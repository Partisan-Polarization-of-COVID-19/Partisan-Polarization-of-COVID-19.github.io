Positive,@Ehassevoort,Why were peaceful protests against stay home stay safe orders deemed unsafe by democrat leaders but the riots and “peaceful” protests we’ve seen since the end of May have been deemed safe by democrat leaders? We were told these events wouldn’t cause the COVID19 spikes we have been seeing the past couple weeks. Why aren’t they being held accountable? Because Democrats only care about one thing. Getting President Trump out of office and could care less if they destroy the USA in the process. MAGA2020 TRUMP2020🇺🇸🇺🇸

Neutral,@DewsNewz,"Why we don’t trust anything coming from the mouths of Fauci, CDC or the NIH criminals..... They have yet to tell their citizens that zinc when used with quercetin (opens the cells up like hydroxychloroquine) is a great cheap preventative and will lesson symptoms of COVID-19 and using Budesonide and other anti inflammatories when diagnosed will ensure rapid recovery most of the time. Instead they mandate mask use, lock downs, expensive high end drugs, ventilators while putting COVID patients into nursing homes, and promoting useless vaccines (which we’ve already paid for).

Positive,@HubLife,The Constitution does NOT give the Federal or State government the right to force me to wear a mask. Full stop. Fuck these commie pricks.
Negative,@Healthyrvguy,"No mask, even medical, is 100% effective against COVID-19. If you look on the boxes of loop masks like the one pictured, the manufacturer will even have a disclaimer that it does not protect against COVID-19 (coronavirus) or any other virus or airborne disease. So, if you are counting on a mask to save you from getting the virus, forget it. Eventually, you probably will get the virus as much as you are active in social settings. Better to keep your immune system ready for the upcoming fight or never to come into contact with another human being during the crisis."
Negative,@carpedonktum,"Went to the post office today, and some guy was freaking out that half of us weren't wearing masks. No I didn't record it, I don't make fun of the mentally disabled(that aren't running for President of the Senate)  Fun fact: Once he left, everyone, masked and unmasked said, asshole, almost in unison. Normal people are done with this crap"
Neutral,@endosispatriot,"During the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco, California, a group of citizens that included doctors and several city supervisors formed an ""Anti-Mask League"" after becoming frustrated with mandated mask-wearing.New York State's anti-mask law was enacted in 1845, to provide for public safety after disputes between landlords and tenants. Many anti-mask laws date back to the mid-20th century, when states and municipalities passed them to stop the violent activities of the Ku Klux Klan, whose members typically wore hoods of white linen to conceal their identities."

Positive,@Healthyrvguy,"VITAMIN D3 and COVID-19 (Important!)   Apparent Link between VITAMIN D3 insufficiency or deficiency and COVID-19.   To protect yourself spend at least 10 dedicated minutes in the sun daily with exposure on head, arms and legs without sunscreen; or eat fish that contain Vitamin D3 Or D2; or take at least 1000 IUs of Vitamin D3. These general guidelines are especially true if you are over 50.   COVID-19 victims in general are insufficient or deficient in Vitamin D. It is important, especially if you are older, to maintain a source for Vitamin D because once you are deficient or insufficient and you get COVID-19, megadose therapy DOES NOT WORK! For further technical reference, please search ""Vitamin D and COVID-19"" on YouTube. It is astonishing the amount of video from the medical field that concur, without exception, on this correlation."
Positive,@Dodgesnob,"I met a nurse from Maricopa county hospital who was angry!! She said that when you get tested for Covid, there are 3 separate test they do. If you are negative, it counts as 1 negative. But if you test positive, it is recorded as THREE positives. The numbers are skewed and we are being lied to, again."

Neutral,@Healthyrvguy,"Yes, the PPP (Payroll Protection Program) has been abused by unscrupulous businesses, but of the money we received, more than $72k went directly to Small Steps Academy so it could remain open and serve the community and give 26 teachers and staff income for 8 weeks. Our money from the program has now been used up, and frankly it will be hard to financially get to the new school year, but with the pandemic I shudder to think how we would have survived at all, without it."
