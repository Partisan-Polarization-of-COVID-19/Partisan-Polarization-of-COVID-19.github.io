Negative,@FreeEarthlings,"Dr. #ReinerFuellmich on #PCRtestScandal  The #Covid19Crisis must be renamed a #CoronaScandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages. How dangerous is the virus? What is the significance of a positive #PCRtest? What is the collateral damage with respect to #health and #economy? An international network of lawyers will argue the biggest #TortCase ever - the #CoronaFraudScandal - which has unfolded into probably the greatest #CrimesAgainstHumanity ever committed. #Scientists and #lawyers recognise that as a result of the deliberate panic-mongering and the corona measures enabled by this panic, #democracy is in great danger of being replaced by #FascistTotalitarian models. To make sure that no one will ever again be in a position of such power as to be able to defraud humanity, or to attempt to manipulate us with their corrupt agendas. #SaveTheEconomy #DefendHumanity #EndLockdowns  #MakeLawLawfulAgain  #GetOffOurRights"

Neutral,@ardevinewriter,Ireland on the verge of possible second lockdown. It is impossible to halt the spread of Covid without a vaccine which might never come. Full lockdowns merely kick the can down the road. Destroying the economy & people's lives for a virus that even in severe cases now unlikely to lead to death is a monumental act of self harm.
Neutral,@ChrisMatei,"The @WHO just backtracked on lockdowns, stating that lockdowns do not help at all.  Well, thanks WHO! Took you 9 months. $83 Trillion wiped out. 150M children pushed into poverty. Millions of suicides. Hundreds of millions who lost their job. Where’s the media? #powertrip"

Neutral,@DaveTheCave,Republicans and Democrats have been profligate with our tax dollars for decades. Now is the time for both to come together to bail out small businesses and unemployed that are in a mess because of government shutdowns. If Republicans have to bend a little to keep businesses open and those who are unemployed solvent so what. Once this pandemic is finished my thought is that both parties will return to their corrupt spending practices and require more tax dollars to do so. Hopefully Trump the outsider will win a second term and put us back on a strong fiscal course.

No! According to the Biden camp we Trump supporters are doomed! BLM/ANTIFA mobs are excused bc it would be racist to report ppl associated with these terrorists burning looting murdering while not wearing masks ate spreading Covid! The fact is ppl get the flu thousands EVERY SINGLE YEAR and some die that’s life. Many Thousands more than ppl w Covid. Flu season has been happening over a century yet NO MANDATORY MASKS! Why? Masks suppress our immune system and make it impossible to become immune to this virus. That’s a proven fact!

Neutral,@DaveTheCave,Republicans and Democrats have been profligate with our tax dollars for decades. Now is the time for both to come together to bail out small businesses and unemployed that are in a mess because of government shutdowns. If Republicans have to bend a little to keep businesses open and those who are unemployed solvent so what. Once this pandemic is finished my thought is that both parties will return to their corrupt spending practices and require more tax dollars to do so. Hopefully Trump the outsider will win a second term and put us back on a strong fiscal course.

The president’s (Trump) Black supporters all point to a handful of policy accomplishments as larger than his public comments. The passage of the First Step Act, the 2018 bipartisan bill that provided one of the largest overhauls of the criminal justice system in decades, is chief among those that they say blunt critiques of the president’s racism. They also point to the $250 million annual increase in funding for historically Black colleges and universities under the FUTURE Act he signed into law in 2019 and Black unemployment numbers that were at their lowest in nearly a decade in the months before the economic downturn caused by the pandemic.

Neutral,@ConservativeMatters,I agree with President Trump. We should not live our lives in fear of COVID19. Cigarette smoking kills 480000 Americans each year. Now that's 100% preventable. Are the Democrats running on a platform of outlawing tobacco? More than double the deaths from COVID19 year after year! Anybody preaching about COVID19 that smokes cigarettes (like President Obama) has no credibility in my life.

First, the NYT called out Biden's lies in the first Presidential debate, now CNN national security reporter Ryan Browne called him out for lies about COVID19.

Folks, every one of these lives mattered,"" Biden said at a rally in Warren, Mich. He did not cite a source for the 6,114 number, but it is off by 6,107, according to the Department of Defense's website. The number of military deaths is seven and the number of combined deaths between military, civilian, dependent, and contractor Department of Defense employees is 90.

Do you regret giving full authority to the governors of each state to handle the situation as they deemed best? For Biden: 1. Can you explain this idea of government-owned land that farmers get to use to plant the crops the government tells them to? 2.

Neutral,@EmbraceTheTruth,"EMBRACE THE TRUTH! Trump is our friend. Are you still wearing your MUZZLE? Are you still partially paralyzed and cowering under the exaggerated threat of Covid-19 propaganda being perpetrated by tyrants and their subservient leftist media? Popularized, “dark forces” are taking advantage of “the people’s” timidity and vulnerability to trust in their lies. This, that they may ultimately, finally control everyone and everything ... Throw off the chains of tyranny. Discard the muzzle. Take back your liberty. Return to the free movement and lifestyle you knew this time last year. We are greater in number and hold greater power than those who would enslave us. They hold no power except that we surrender. If “they” (the leftists) succeed in the upcoming elections, our freedoms, our way of “Life, Liberty, Property, and Pursuit of Happiness” will fall under “their” command."
Neutral,@GLCampos,"O enviado especial da Organização Mundial da Saúde em COVID-19 exortou os líderes mundiais esta semana a parar de ""usar lockdown como seu método de controle primário.""  “Nós, na Organização Mundial da Saúde, não defendemos os bloqueios como o principal meio de controle desse vírus”, disse o Dr. David Nabarro a Andrew Neil do The Spectator. “A única vez em que acreditamos que um lockdown se justifica é para ganhar tempo para reorganizar, reagrupar, reequilibrar seus recursos, proteger seus profissionais de saúde que estão exaustos, mas, em geral, preferimos não fazer isso.”"

Neutral,@Angie71,Ok- I am in the process of composing an email to not only my sons school but to the LEA. This week he came home to tell me that they had to sit through a 30min assembly about BLM and next week are having to do 5 x 20mins workshops during form time to work on black history month. They were told saying ‘All lives matter’ was problematic and would invoke sanctions against the students if they said it. They were told the NHS and white midwives were racist- the virus was racist and that white people were inherently and unconsciously racist.  They said George Floyd had committed only minor offences and died crying out he couldn’t breathe when on the floor pinned by the cops knee. They said stop and search was racist. They said asking a minority person about themselves culturally and wanting to touch for eg hair(if braided or in dreadlocks etc)through genuine interest is a micro aggression. I checked the Govt stance on political indoctrination and it’s strictly forbidden in schools? Help me!
