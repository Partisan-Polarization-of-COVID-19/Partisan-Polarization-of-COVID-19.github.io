Negative,@dianedueck,"Of course they had to make masks essential and normal so that they can't mandate no masks for rioters,protesters,and Antifa."
Negative,@Derek,Dr. Fauci was caught by Americas Voice News for taking his mask off when the hearing was over. You can’t make this up.

Neutral,@gaypatriot,It's just a mask? It's just two weeks. It's just non-essential businesses. It's just to keep from overwhelming the hospitals. It's just until cases go down more. It's just to keep others from being scared. It's just for a few more weeks. It's just until we get a vaccine. It's just a few side effects. It's just to let people know you're safe to be around. It's just for the coronavirus vaccine. It's just a few more months. It’s just a video. It’s just an email account. It's just for protecting others from hate speech. It's just a few people. It's just a credit card company.  It's just a little chip. It’s just for medical information and paying for things. It’s just so you can travel. It’s just so you can get your driver’s license. It’s just so you can vote. It's just for a few more years. It's just a statue. It's just a building. It's just a song. It’s just a piece of paper. It's just a flag. It's just a piece of cloth. It's not just a piece of cloth. It's not just a mask.
Neutral,@Gtarecking,The Mask President Trump wore at Walter Reed Hospital will be a Highlight at his Library when HE leaves office in 2025 or Later!!!
Neutral,@ConservativeCher,Something is up with Gov Abbott . I am surprised he is “ masking “ us up again ! It is not healthy and is not helping our state of minds.  The death rates are down dramatically yet all they report is how many people tested positive today - 3000 people tested positive and there were 9 deaths . Something close to that !!
Neutral,@ghedger,Great news if true: Florida well on its way to herd immunity for novel coronavirus:

Negative,@CompetentConservative,"If you really think a full stadium of Nascar fans would have put up with this BLM stunt you are either dumb or not American. Congrats to the Chinese Wuhan virus. China is empowering and enabling the worst our country has to offer; what do you figure, they don't want to fight us, they want us to fight ourselves first. Pushback on the Chinese Wuhan virus. Call it what it is so everyone knows. This virus is more contagious than than the flu yet less people have died from it. We all saw how the CDC has walked back and forth with body counts from the start, and had basic precautionary measure been taken where needed the most, you wouldn't have half the fatalities we had, especially in NY. The weak need to protect themselves to a higher standard not everyone, this is just a power move to shut down the blue collar boom, the real Patriots of this country who work and who don't want to stop."
Neutral,@JohnRiley,"A plane has five passengers on board: Donald Trump, the Pope, Dr. Anthony Fauci, Nancy Pelosi, and a ten year old school girl. The plane is about to crash and there is only four parachutes. Dr Fauci, said “I need one, I have to help develop a cure for the global health crisis that is COVID19!” He straps on a parachute and jumps. The pope said “I need one, I have to help spiritually guide people through the global health crisis that is COVID19!” He takes one and jumps. Pelosi said ‘‘I need one, I’m the smartest woman in the United States.” she takes one and jumps. President Trump pauses for a moment and then turns to the 10-year-old. After a deep sigh, he says tenderly, ""You can have the last parachute. I've lived my life, yours is only starting"". The child replies, ""Don’t worry, there are two parachutes left. The smartest woman in the United States took my school backpack."

Neutral,@halerazor,The recent spike in new coronavirus cases is very concerning. If only there was a series of public gatherings that suddenly appeared 3-4 weeks ago on which to blame it.
Neutral,@billmcgee,"A James Woods Tweet. Rioters and looters and mobs packed together like sardines, howling and spewing spittle, have swarmed over the urban landscape for weeks. The #CoronaVirus has now exploded. The cause and effect model is so simple and obvious, only the Democrat-owned media could ignore it."
