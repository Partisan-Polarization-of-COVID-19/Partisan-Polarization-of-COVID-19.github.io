Neutral,@ardevinewriter,Ireland on the verge of possible second lockdown. It is impossible to halt the spread of Covid without a vaccine which might never come. Full lockdowns merely kick the can down the road. Destroying the economy & people's lives for a virus that even in severe cases now unlikely to lead to death is a monumental act of self harm.

Neutral,@Cartoys93,Hmmmm .... So I thought wearing a mask meant you were just a slave to the man . It‚Äôs a whole different meaning .

Positive,@ardevinewriter,One good thing about covid 19 is that social distancing etiquette has spared many young women a sniffing from Joe Biden.
Negative,@Georgechristensen,"In the first of this two-part interview for Conservative One, the podcast defending Traditions and Freedom, host George Christensen (Australian Member of Parliament) interviews the former chaplain to the Queen, Dr Gavin Ashenden, about the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic, the Church and religious freedom. This podcast episode was recorded in April 2020 but is being premiered on The Good Sauce for the first time."
Neutral,@Cordelldishman123,"Trump says up to 10 countries set for peace with Israel. Be ready! Bible prophecy is being fulfilled before our eyes, whether you like President Trump or not (hold your thumbs, this isn‚Äôt about him nor do I care to hear it) he has already fulfilled one of the last prophecies in the Bible prior to Jesus‚Äô return. Moving the US Embassy in Israel back to Jerusalem and recognizing Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel is one of the prophecies that must be fulfilled. No other President in history has done this, but Donald Trump did. We haven‚Äôt seen nothing yet!! What the world is experiencing right now is Just the tip of the iceberg!!! Just in case anyone wonders where I stand: The 7-year tribulation will be worse by far than anything anyone could imagine. If you think this is our last Pandemic or ""natural"" disaster you are sadly mistaken. Read the book of Revelation. As a Christian, I‚Äôve heard about the corruption and debauchery of the end-times most of my life. It appears the book of Revelati"

Neutral,@EkimAulthar,"COVID has fucked us all; between loss of business, social events, civil liberties, or even in some cases our loved ones. Thing is; you can't blow COVID's brains out and paint nearby walls with it. But, one can do that (and vent your frustration and hatred) to a communist. And they've demonstrated that they can (and will) do the same to us (""us"" being anyone *slightly* to the right of Pol Pot).... This doesn't bode too good for any form of PeaCE.  And (despite my choices in video games,) I'm not too fond of the idea of a war going on right here in my neighborhood..."
