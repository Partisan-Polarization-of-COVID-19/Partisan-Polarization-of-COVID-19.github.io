Negative,@DeeHicksExplantLiaison,"So let me get this straight. We have an enormous amount of poverty, hunger, child abuse, sex trafficking, murder, vaccine death and injury, missing children and a government and Pharmaceutical industry that becomes richer by the minute and you believe a pandemic with an incredibly low death rate is their top priority? They have destroyed lives, the economy, and are fining people that choose to not wear a mask, arrest business owners that try to make a living, manipulate people, cancel weddings, limit numbers at funerals, exclude visitors from hospitals, cause a mass genocide in nursing homes, cause a race war, intend to mandate vaccines and track people like animals and you think you’re “doing your part” by wearing a mask and social distancing? Unreal.  #qanon #nomasks #echo #trump2020 #kag2020 #deepstateexposed #maga"
Positive,@flintbedrock,Wear a mask if you want to but let’s be clear about what it can and what it cannot do.
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,“It’s just a mask....”

Positive,@CNOEvol,I tried to get HCQ from my doctor and was told supply is scarce and it is reserved for rhematoid arthritis patients. The truth is livelihoods are at stake. In a true pandemic resources would be allocated to stop the spread of the virus. When combined with zinc HCQ has been proven effective in over 50 global studies. Lawsuits need to be going forward against anyone censoring information about HCQ.

Neutral,@CNOEvol,"I found out today that my doctor in the Chattanooga area will not prescribe Hydroxychloroqine. Apparently it is for Rhematoid Arthritis patients only. If this were a Pandemic why are we not allocating resources to prevent the spread of a deadly virus? I researched it all summer and know it is mostly an over the counter medication in other countries and very cheap. A person needs 200mg twice a week and a zinc supplement to prevent Covid. As a teacher about to reenter the classroom I expected to be able to get the drug...it is not a narcotic, is not addicting and is FDA approved. In a capitalist society demand drives supply...I feel my doctor is part of the problem and putting politics above my safety. He is not driving the demand therefore nothing changes. Then I asked a pharmacist...1st the insurance company was to blame then the state pharmacy board. These people need to be held accountable...there is a way to stop the virus...the gatekeepers need to protect the people."
Neutral,@DSMW,"There May Never Be a ‘Silver Bullet’ for COVID-19, WHO Warns"
Neutral,@boutiquegurl,"Obesity is one of the top comorbidities for contracting Covid-19... So, why aren’t we talking about that? Why aren’t we encouraging people to get healthy, and making them responsible for their own health? #letsmakeamericahealthyagain #peopleareresponsiblefortheirownhealth"
Neutral,@DebbieDsouza,"They found a cure for covid but the FDA, Big Pharma, the CDC and Fauci don’t want you to know because it doesn’t fit their narrative ! Please watch the entire conference - Made me a believer! #CovidCure"
Neutral,@boutiquegurl,"While being healthy isn’t a guarantee I won’t get COVID-19, it is one of the best deterrents. You see, the best defense against this virus is sunshine, exercise, nutritious foods, supplements, and getting a good night’s sleep, and my health is my responsibility, not yours! #myhealthismyresponsibility"
Neutral,@BethBurdick,"Can't help but feel irked that #johnlewis can have all this pomp and circumstance for his funeral, yet my mother, and so many others, could not have a simple family funeral during this virus. God bless him, but feeling pissed off."
Neutral,@Chloeca1970,Robert De Niro's lawyer says coronavirus has caused the actor financial strain Anyone have any sympathy for him?
