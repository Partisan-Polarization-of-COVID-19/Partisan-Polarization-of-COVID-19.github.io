Positive,@JohnnyHammer,"Nancy gets special treatment! In the Communist State of #Pennsylvania you have to wear a mask to get a haircut! Pelosi used shuttered San Francisco hair salon for blow-out, owner calls it 'slap in the face' | Fox News"
Positive,@Guitarshp,"There is no law requiring you to wear a mask. If you can protest in person you can vote in person. If walmart can remain open then so can your church. They asked for 15 days, then 30. We've given them 161. If you don't have all your freedoms back yet, go take them back. Today."

Neutral,@Bottomgun,A better way to use those masks.

Neutral,@Dkmraider1962,President Trump needs to initiate a higher education Project Warp Speed. Any public school who continues to churn out meaningless social science and other useless degrees to indoctrinate our youth instead of an equivalent amount of STEM degrees should have their tax payer funded subsidies eliminated!! @TrishRegan   @TeamTrump   @Mariabartiromotv
Negative,@HubLife,California Patriots have had enough of the Shamdemic.
Negative,@FiveArrows,"It‚Äôs an interesting thing watching someone go through the stages of taking the red pill.  My wife had her eyes opened during the shamdemic. First by watching Out of Shadows a couple months ago and then by researching the stuff she saw in that documentary.  Since then, she has been spending hours researching all the evil that has been hidden for so long.  At first she was in shock. Then she was disgusted and angry. Right now she is somewhere between anger and sadness.  I understand the necessity of the stages, having gone through them myself, but it sure is hard to watch someone you love swallow the bitter red pill and realize her reality isn‚Äôt what she thought it was."
Negative,@cjtruth,SHOCK: CDC: 94% of Covid-19 deaths had underlying medical conditions According to the CDC 9683 died in the United States with only having COVID-19 listed on their death certificate. The Covid hoax has always been a hoax. Those who have been involved in this hoax should be prosecuted to the fullest extent.

Negative,@Jeff71,"I know the Red Herring used by the MSM that people were calling the China Virus a hoax. THATS A LIE, THEY WERE AND STILL ARE actually referring to the spin attached to it. The virus is real, the deaths are real, but the politicized narrative is a lie. The truth comes out eventually."

Negative,@Dtrozas,"When to HANG Fauci? The Tweets, combined with Fauci‚Äôs radical conduct, prompted Trump to direct the Justice Department to investigate the Fauci-Obama connection. Investigators learned‚Äî& apparently leaked‚Äîdata proving that in 2015 Obama instructed Fauci to authorize a $3.5 million ‚Äúdonation‚Äù to a Wuhan virology lab. Fox News & the Washington Post have run articles questioning whether Covid-19 originated at the Wuhan facility. Additionally, a wiretap on Fauci‚Äôs phone and electronic devices revealed the good doctor and the disgraced former president have kept a close friendship; intercepted phone calls and emails showed that Obama and Fauci had conspired to undermine Trump‚Äôs authority by having Fauci give the president unsound medical advice in matters involving the pandemic. First, Fauci told Trump the virus was ‚Äúnothing to worry about.‚Äù Then he reversed course and warned Trump Covid-19 would utterly ravage the country unless martial law-like steps were at once taken to curb the spread."

Neutral,@Denglishman,"In this episode I expose Joe Biden as the liar he absolutely is AND I show you the proof that ‚ÄúCOMI‚Äù Kamala Harris is too inept and uncaring to become the president should Biden kick the bucket or worse, the DNC removes Biden under the 25th amendment and installs COMI as POTUS. I show you why and how the news media has been propagandized since 2012 due to a bill passed by the house which Barry Soetoro AKA Barack Obama signed into law as an attachment to the NDAA. I also show you how COVID19 has been legally propagandized due to that law. Folks, we are being used so the left can further their agenda. Wake up America, your jailers are looking for legitimacy."

Neutral,@jazzy45,"FYI: Do you know that a "" Covid-19 "" sensor has been inserted secretly into every phone? Apparently when every one was having a phone disruption earlier this week, they were adding COVID -19 tracker to our phones If you have an android phone, go under settings, then look for Google settings and see if it's there. If you are using an iPhone, go under settings, privacy, then health, it's there but not yet functional. The app can notify you if you've been near someone that have reported having COVID-19. Don't turn it on because you will be traced everywhere you go but once you update your phone, it will automatically be turned on on our phones. Just remember to go back in and turn it off.  ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ I just checked my iPhone - it is there !"
