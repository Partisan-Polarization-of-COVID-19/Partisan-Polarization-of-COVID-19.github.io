Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"An apartment complex in Ventura County, CA is locking their residents inside the building until all of them are tested for Covid. I called the number, was put on hold, & then eventually forwarded to voicemail. This is the dangerous slope we‚Äôve been talking about - & it‚Äôs exactly what the Cabal wants. They don‚Äôt even have to mandate laws or draft legislation when landlords, banks, businesses, etc. will go along with the agenda & require this out of their tenants /customers. And what happens if 1 child tests positive in a public school setting? Will they lockdown that entire school until every kid is forcefully tested then shipped to a ‚Äúquarantine facility‚Äù if positive? This is called tyranny & it never ends up well for us citizens. It‚Äôs time to wake up & fight for our God-given rights. #WWG1WGA"
Positive,@ivmedia,"You HAVE to wear a mask in the car.  Why?  Well, when you‚Äôre alone in the car without a mask, you‚Äôre spreading your germs onto all the non-porous surfaces in your car, which COULD BECOME A PROBLEM if you decide to give someone a ride later on.  YOU HAVE TO WEAR A MASK  YOU UNDERSTAND YET, YOU INSIGNIFICANT PIECE OF SHIT INCAPABLE OF MAKING BASIC DECISIONS"
Positive,@Clinton614,"Toronto man assaults customer for not wearing a mask. Be aware libtards. I don't wear a mask anywhere I go, and if you pull a stunt like this on me I'll beat your ass! #clinton614"
Neutral,@chanduvall,Interesting perspective. Masks are a muzzle. They are taking away what makes you human.
Neutral,@bradhammer1951,Government mandated wearing of masks is a subliminal attempt to rob individuality and make everyone part of the collective.
Neutral,@191powm,"Nashville councilwoman suggests legislation charging those without a mask with murder or attempted murder...IF THEY WOULD ELECT A LITTLE MORE INTELLIGENT CLASS OF PEOPLE, WE WOULD NOT BE READING THIS GARBAGE..."
Neutral,@Healthyrvguy,READ THIS BOOK!! The SCIENCE behind masks explained simply by 2 NY Times best-selling authors in the medical field. $7 on Amazon. Share this with as many people as you can! (I have no financial interest in this book - just want the TRUTH to be known)
Neutral,@Healthyrvguy,"Today a judge in California prevented a restraining order against Grace Community Church of Sun Valley, California! In her ruling she said that the government could not tell a church whether to have services or not, whether it would be indoors or outdoors, what capacity it could fill and whether it could have singing or not. That's a big Praise The Lord! (Maybe the Constitutional rights of The People will finally be returned to them! It's time the government quits overstepping the Constitution, and that goes for masks and what businesses can and can't be open, and the assembly of The People!)"
Neutral,@chanduvall,Covid vaccine study.
Neutral,@chanduvall,"Just posting some credibility to this post...even though I'm no specialist in it. I was a statistics TA at BYU for two semesters. It is really easy to spread false propaganda with numbers (DUH). One of the things that has been happening ON THE DAILY are websites showing you the number of positive cases being ""confirmed."" That would be like news outlets showing us daily how many new births are taking place and how it would peak in June, since that is when most births occur. Watching numbers go up each day, even if it is only a few, is meant to cause FEAR. It is trying to tell you that the numbers are increasing and it is hounding those numbers in your face DAILY. Not giving you a break. If you hear things long enough, you will eventually believe it. You need to compare these numbers and understand the demographics of that population. Look into herd immunity if you are not already familiar with it."

Neutral,@Andrewccadman,Don't know if this is true but if so then it may well have a lot to do with the extreme fatalism of Islam. It is blasphemy to suggest that muslims can deny the will of Allah who decides when your time has come. Yet another example of the incompatibilities of islam and Western thought.  #Islam #covid-19
Neutral,@believingican,What's going on with our COVID daily counts in Texas  @GovGregAbbottTX  ? We have have daily counts up to 8/2 we didn't get a count. Now again on 8/5 we didn't get a count. What are you guys doing? Saving up the numbers on low days so you can add them to the next day so the numbers will stay higher?
Neutral,@believingican,"Somethings happening in the Texas COVID counts, on 8/2, 8/5, and 8/7 we have had no updateson the number of infections. Did the UT and TAM graduates suddenly forget how to count? Or could it be that the numbers are falling and they are counting multiple days to keep the numbers up? It appears to me we have Bolshevik in the spread sheet somewhere!"
Neutral,@Demfools,"Planted this garden with my family. Was just laid off from my job, COVID hit, therapy was needed!! Giving thanks to my God and my President that the Cares Act was passed really helped get through what would have otherwise been a tough time. This first Sun Flower is a symbol of hope and faith!! In the past two weeks found a new job doing what I love. And a big thank you to the Trump administration for the financial help. Now he wants to help those who are still struggling and the Democrats won‚Äôt let him. To my friends still not working there is hope, your sunflower will bloom also. Support the man that wants to help us and your garden will shine two fold! November is very important for us all. President Trump is our Hope!! üôèüôèüôè"
