Negative,@DMR2cor520,What if horror movies were a way to research what scares you? What if they’ve been perfecting their craft? What if #2020 has been the live action culmination of everything that scares you? You’re in a “theater” of war.  How do you escape? Take off your mask 😷

Neutral,@Demfools,"A plane has five  passengers on board: Donald Trump, a Pastor,  Dr. Anthony Fauci,  Nancy Pelosi, and a  ten year old school girl.  The plane is about to crash and there are only four parachutes. Dr Fauci, said “I need one,  I have to help develop a cure for the global health crisis  that is COVID19!”  He straps on a parachute  and jumps. The Pastor said “I need one,  I have to help spiritually guide people through the global health crisisthat is COVID19!”  He takes one and jumps. Pelosi said ‘‘I need one, I’m the smartest woman in the United States.” She takes one and jumps. President Trump pauses for a moment and then turns to the 10-year-old. After a deep sigh, he says tenderly, ""You can have the last parachute. I've lived my life,  yours is only starting"".  The child replies,  ""Don’t worry, there are  two parachutes left.  The smartest woman in  the United States took  my school backpack. 😂😂😂🤦‍♀️🤦‍♀️😂😂😂"
Neutral,@Dodgesnob,"I just found out that While my phone was down on Monday, a Covid tracker was installed. I also had to tell my county that automatically put me on a mail in ballot, that I refuse the ballot I want to vote in person. Something tells me that two months prior to the election, I should leave my phone home and off."
