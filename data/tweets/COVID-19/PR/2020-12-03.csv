Positive,@Gregmo49,Sick and tired of mayors ordering people have to stay home and then do what ever they want. When they are caught all they have say ‚ÄúI am sorry‚Äù and we are to forget about their evil deed. From now on they should be arrested placed in jail removed from office and a heavy monetary find.

Neutral,@Bobalee,Now some on the left are beating up on Cubans in Miami for listening to Trump telling them about the left‚Äôs socialistic leanings. Cuban brothers know what socialist smell like better than any of us. Socialists live off of other people‚Äôs hard earned money and suck the blood out of hardworking people and their nations economy until they are a Skeleton of their former self. Then socialist leaders imprison anybody that looks at them the wrong way or sometimes these citizens just disappear.  You think not. Just look at what the dem governors are doing with the coronavirus lockdowns while at the same time they break their own rules. And they have some limits on their power.
Negative,@HappyLiberals,"People don't like to echo these statements but I can get 359K for breaking one of Hunters **** pics. You can say whatever you want but if you meant it 99.99% of the store would be maskless like me. You know what I don't want and you should understand? I don't want my daughter to meet her husband with a mask on and maybe see eachother for the first time on their wedding night if the Governor ""allows"" - let alone be told i don't have the ""right to attend the wedding"" [something like holding my mothers hand when she dies]. Got it? Stop talking. I'm ashamed of you. Why shouldn't I be?"
Positive,@JeffHimself,"I would like to ask the media, FoxNews, BreitbartNews, and others. What has to be revealed for the Media to say, ‚ÄúHey, there was some voter fraud that happened?‚Äù I heard Andrew and Jerome on Breitbart that says every morning, ‚Äúthere is no evidence of this voter fraud you all are talking about!‚Äù Jerome had no empathy about the frustration of voters that go to the poles to believe that their vote counts or that someone would just increase the Democrats votes more to ensure a win. Why is that the peasant can see things happening but the media can‚Äôt? How can we trust the media? My thought is, we are the peasants and we must keep moving the direction, with our mask on, that the deep state and media tells us. I can see things getting worse and not better. Media is not for the peasants they are for the money. #deepstate #breitbartnews #foxnews. I can hear not too far in the future, the train to load up peasants that do not comply. It‚Äôs going down and media is involved."

Negative,@Jmastersherm,"I'm getting the feeling that we may see either partial or full blown #Martial Law, especially now that the China Virus was delivered earlier than reported. We cannot let the Obama led Coup stand."
Negative,@iSpeakDEMOCRAT,The insanity here is that desperate people will look to those who created to the problem to be the solution. #democrats are counting on it. The #democratvirus has yielded far more than a #stolenelection - democrats have seen how they can now control behavior on a massive scale. They will not let this go easily and   they will politicize the #vaccine in ways you can't imagine yet. It's coming.  #ccpvirus #parler #
Negative,@DeplorableC,"Cuomo KNEW what he was doing when he ordered infected patients into nursing homes. He KNEW NY would receive more money from the Feds for each Wuhan virus death, so he maximized his ability to make money off the virus by packing the homes with the sick. There were tractor trailers parked outside the facilities to receive the steady stream of bodies...remember? At the same time, he was reducing the number of people relying on the state for their very existence, and therefore reducing NY expenditures for the poor and elderly. Afterall, NY state budget is BILLIONS in the red and Trump refused to bail the state out. And let's not forget, Cuomo said himself that HIS mother would never go to a nursing home. I guess a check from the Feds for $39,000 wasn't enough to let her die afraid and alone in a state run home."

Neutral,@GaDawg1,"So you've got experts from IT to statistical analysis to programming to forensics, with multiple years of experience and working in their related fields analyzing everything that is happening with this election. Trust science right? An average 6th grader, given the facts, could tell you there is massive election fraud taking place. Well, remember what they did with the doctors that blew the whistle on covid and how hydroxychloroquine is the cure and how the PCR test is not a diagnostic tool? I'm sure they're trying to debunk these professionals as conspiracy theorists also. Just like Joe Biden said, ""plausible deniability."" It's not plausible anymore and you can't deny it because we all see it. It's Crystal clear and we're not going to let you steal it. Get it? The line has been crossed. All those who sold their souls to Satan and their master üí∞ are in for a very rude awakening very soon. You played and now you got to pay. If you think you walk away from this, you better think again."
Neutral,@Domcarthur,"Perfect ending for 2020! Between COVID-19 and the drama of the elections, most of us will probably be glad to put 2020 in the rearview mirror. But there's still holiday shopping to do before we get to ring in the New Year. If you dread heading out to the mall to find that thoughtful gift for your erudite friend or relative (or maybe for yourself), consider a copy of Full Circle, the first of eight novels in the Civil War series. The book is available in paperback, Kindle, or free (if you have a Kindle Unlimited subscription).   If you've already read the book, please consider writing a review.  I'm cleaning out shelf space to make room for the next book in the series, Questionable Intent, due out early next year. If you'd like a signed copy of Full Circle, or would like to send a signed copy to someone else, please message me and we'll work out the logistics. In the meantime, have a Merry Christmas!"
