Neutral,@JeffDahlSr,10.2.20: TEN days of DARKNESS/Quarantine? RED OCTOBER! via @YouTube
Neutral,@Dianalzr,While the President quarantines for COVID-19 it‚Äôs a good time to remember where he took this Country pre-Covid.
Neutral,@GriffinJ,"Just heard Trumps quarantine is extremely serious.  He won't be leaving the White House until January 20, 2025.  üíï Please pray for him! üíï"

Neutral,@CommonSenseIsNotSoCommon,"So why are some places still locked down and wearing masks? CDC Data Shows Coronavirus Survival Rate: 99%-Plus for Ages 69 and Younger, 94.6% for Older"
Neutral,@Cherokeeowl,"Folks you can riot, loot & burn in the streets- you can harass the police, innocent law abiding citizens in their homes & anyone wearing MAGA gear  But you damn sure better not be at an OUTDOOR event not wearing a liberal mask! You‚Äôll get tased & arrested!!  I think we are beyond the point of lunacy!  #cocass  #co4djt  #gijoevets  #tn2"

Neutral,@Dianalzr,Don‚Äôt forget - if President Trump breezes through Covid-19 on a certain medical protocol for Covid at 74 years of age - so can you. And President Trump will walk out of that hospital saying so ....the Dems and Media fear that.

Neutral,@CommonSenseIsNotSoCommon,Beast mode!! White House Physician: President Trump Reports No COVID-19 Symptoms
Neutral,@Dianalzr,"We should just speak the truth. 94% of all those dying from Covid-19 were close to death prior to being infected. To emphasize that fact would reduce fear, and would also enable us to better protect the vulnerable from the virus."
Neutral,@Chickmcd,"On the bright side president Trump and the First lady will have had it and survived it. The Americans people would not have to worry about them getting it again.  On the other hand Biden not in the best of health, has not and will be susceptible to getting COVID in office if elected. If the worst should happen that would leave the country in the hands of Kamela Harris, Pelosie and Shummer. Do you think America would survive?"
Neutral,@Jessatek,My wife‚Äôs food truck operating in SW Virginia! Call 919-841-0276 to schedule any event you need great food and service for.  Forgive the advertisement but the end of the season is approaching and the COVID cancellations early in the season was devastating to her two year old business.  Thanks!   Slider Kings Food Truck.
Neutral,@Creplov,"Is anyone besides me starting to get worried. Between Covid, the rioting, so many out of work, the multitude of mail in voting problems, Trump getting sick, the debates, the lack of factual reporting by the MSM, and now evil Nancy doing her thing.. ..I am slowly going into a panic mode. Our country will no longer be America, the America we love, if Trump loses. I keep saying there has to be enough sane ones around us that must see through most of this. But I live in CT and it is so blue that most sanity is barely found here. I am truly part of the silent majority."
Neutral,@Etherbunny,"This afternoon, I met a girlfriend to pick up a couple Sean Parnell and Trump/Pence signs. We were talking to one another about our health issues and covid. Out of nowhere this hostile guy approached us, shouting, "" F+#k Trump!"" He repeated it and then yelled at us saying that. Trump f#@+ed up our country. Diane and I were shocked! I said, ""Well, God bless you, Sir"" and my friend said something softly too. He looked at me and yelled ""F#@k you""! He clearly was suffering from severe Trump Derangement Syndrome. The one guy pumping gas in his truck yelled ""Trump 2020"" twice. The other guy was highly agitated. I walked to my vehicle via the guy's truck. He was ready to protect me. WTH is wrong with people!!! Out of nowhere, I was verbally assaulted simply because I held signs in my hand while talking to a friend!! You wonder why I have issues with the leftists!"
Neutral,@DiamondAndSilk,"If plexiglass couldn't stop a fly, how can it stop a virus?  Both are airborne, right?"
Neutral,@Jm451373,"Of course there is foul play. It‚Äôs strange no one has gotten this virus the whole time. Then less than a month before the election, boom....they‚Äôre dropping like flies."
Neutral,@Americansforpeace,Our prayers are with the first family today. The insidious nature of this virus is a reminder of how fragile life liberty and the pursuit of happiness truly are to all humanity. God bless you and may God bless the United States of America. üá∫üá∏‚úåÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
