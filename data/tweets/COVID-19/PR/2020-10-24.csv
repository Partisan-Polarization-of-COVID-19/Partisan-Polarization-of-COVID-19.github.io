Negative,@FreeEarthlings,"Dr. #ReinerFuellmich on #PCRtestScandal  The #Covid19Crisis must be renamed a #CoronaScandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages. How dangerous is the virus? What is the significance of a positive #PCRtest? What is the collateral damage with respect to #health and #economy? An international network of lawyers will argue the biggest #TortCase ever - the #CoronaFraudScandal - which has unfolded into probably the greatest #CrimesAgainstHumanity ever committed. #Scientists and #lawyers recognise that as a result of the deliberate panic-mongering and the corona measures enabled by this panic, #democracy is in great danger of being replaced by #FascistTotalitarian models.
