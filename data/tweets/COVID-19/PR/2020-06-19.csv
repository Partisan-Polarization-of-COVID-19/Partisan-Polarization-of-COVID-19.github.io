Positive,@Jbartosz67,Police are ordered to “stand down” and let these criminals destroy our cities. A mom gets arrested for taking her kid to the park during a stay at home order. Are we all nuts?!
Neutral,@ETTalkShow,FINALLY! Fauci Admits Widespread Lockdowns Not Needed In U.S.
Neutral,@DrGosar,"40 Million Unemployed and the Defeat Of America  I was proud to vote for the tax relief bill, the energy bills and the deregulatory policies that helped President Trump create the greatest economy in our lives.  Now, after 90 days of shutdowns, closures, and fear-mongering, we have 40 million unemployed. Also the most in our lifetimes.  Immigration, both illegal and legal, is the biggest threat to our economic recovery. With 40 million unemployed all immigration needs to halt.  Tucker Carlson nails it: “This is a crisis, as profound and dangerous as any war we’ve fought. God help us if we don’t fix it soon. Finding work for Americans has to be our top priority.    A huge number of American jobs are now occupied by foreign nationals, many jobs that Americans would be thrilled to have — white collar jobs, the kind your kids studied for in college, but can’t get.” End OPT. End work visas. Hire AMERICAN citizens. Our nation’s survival is at stake."
Neutral,@HippieConservative,"Sigghhh...this mornings thoughts. This should NOT be American Vs American, it's Americans vs Tyrannical government. American citizens have been living in oppressive tyrannical Democratic run cities. They are American Citizens...Excessive lock downs, arrested going to work, murder with No charges (until this morning)...this IS Tyranny.  Although their anger, we know is mis-guided #thanksobama, #thanksfakenews, and inundated with propaganda to solidify the democratic agenda...WE KNOW BETTER...and while looting is not OK, standing up against this tyranny IS! Who we ALL should be angry with @jabob_frey, why didn't you have your police chief arrest that murderer? UNITED WE STAND If you decide White Americans did this to your city and come for me, then we will not agree. There I said it. #maga2020"
Neutral,@HippieConservative,"Listen Patriots if you are still trying to figure out how we all got played, stop it. This is a long time coming globalist terrorist attack on Democracy and White People directly. Next is target cops and properties, show angry white people shooting protesters. Headlines read Trump and Racist supporters kill 500,000 us citizens protesting for equality. The suppression of speech, excessive lock downs and then attack was funded by Soros and Clintons. This is worldwide globalist takeover, blacklivesmatter are protesting on behalf of George in other countries, their liberation is when America ends. Welcome to the New World Order. We ain't gonna fight our way outta this, their propaganda is strong We and Trump are the Nazis...just ask my liberal boyfriend."

Negative,@Invisibleme45,Yes! Take off the masks! Stop the fear mongering! Let’s all refuse to wear masks!
Neutral,@JimLin,I would advise the protesters not to accept those masks. Who knows how many people have touched those masks and then you put them on your face. A good way to spread the virus.
Neutral,@Jfields1118,Perfect mask!
Neutral,@ICthruIt,Corona Virus Positive Thought of the Day - At least the rioters have a nice variety of masks to choose from these days.

Positive,@DivaDeb,"i hate this wench. She is ruining our state. Bitch aint social distancing, way more than 100 ppl.. nice photo op"
Positive,@Jaetress,"It’s not lost on me that the same media that last week was condemning beach visitors for poor social distancing performance is now praising these protesters walking arm-in-arm down the streets of the United States. In basically a week, Corona is once again nothing but a decent Mexican beer."
Positive,@BurfordCarrie,"EZm2EeIX0AE9Yut.jpg THE SWAMP RUNS DEEP. They want you divided. They want you labeled by race, religion, class, sex, etc. Divided you are weak [no collective power].

Positive,@BoertjieEngelsman,"Must say, quite awesome to see so many people from the UK and USA actually standing up to the bullshit perpetuated by the MSM. Let's stand together to build a better world, lets resist the hatred, fight the division. #WEAREALLHUMANS I say FUCK THE POLITICIANS!"

Neutral,@FedUpConservative,"I am putting these out here.. I am deeply saddened by what happened to George Floyd, but I am sick of being told that there is endemic ‘racism’ in policing/society. I am sickened by the rioting/protests destroying already down trodden communities and businesses. I am sickened by the families of Covid fatalities who STILL can not hold funerals/services for THEIR LOVED ONES, yet a mob of people can attend THREE FUNERALS in THREE STATES- while families with seniors can not visit their loved ones. I am sickened by these lives taken by violent criminals and ignored. I am SICK OF THE HYPOCRISY"

Neutral,@JimLin,"I am sharing this I walked away about 2 weeks into this whole Coronovirus mess. I wasn’t a diehard democratic, but I felt those were the people I thought stood for we the people, and republicans were greedy, ruining this country. I was one of those people that hated Trump for the last 3 years. I called him a liar, an idiot, amongst many other things. I was convinced he was ruining this country. WOW was I wrong!!! One day I was watching Trumps daily virus briefing and something just clicked. He isn’t dumb or stupid, no he’s just not a politician, he’s just like you or me. He tells it like it is and truly cares about America. It was literally like a fog was lifted and I could see clearly, it was a weird felling. From there the researcher began and it felt like I opened Pandora’s box. Everything I knew and had been told, taught, and shown was bullshit! I can’t watch the nightly news anymore, was an old nightly tradition, the blatant lies and the skewed media reporting makes me sick now. I"
Neutral,@HBowman,43% of Chinese Coronavirus deaths come from .6% of the population.
Neutral,@JennaEllisEsq,How is it possible to be under tyranny and anarchy in Dem controlled cities simultaneously? Their tyranny isn’t about coronavirus. Their anarchy isn’t about racism. They abhor the rule of law.  It’s all about complete power and total destruction of America and our virtue.
Neutral,@JimLin,"At Kate’s softball game just now, the umpire got too hot and passed out. He was a black man. A couple white men caught him and a few people IMMEDIATELY came to his aid. They threw his gear off and began to cool him down. As he regained consciousness and asked for water and his sandwich because he hadn’t eaten today, I watched a white woman grab his food and begin to feed him. In this instant, nobody cared about skin color, or coronavirus. They were able bodied people helping a man in distress. I promise, there’s a lot more of this than there is of all the “one color against another” that is plastered all over news outlets and social media. THIS is what it’s about. Loving each other and helping those in distress."
