Positive,@hardwood64,"Okay so I'm in Arizona where the covid cases are mysteriously skyrocketing the closer we get to the election. My friend's grandfather who is on a pacemaker and has numerous other ailments, recently felt strange so he went in for a test and it cane back positive (of course) and all they did was send him home with basic instructions on what to look for before he feels he should come back in? That seems REALLY shady to me. I'd hate to think they are fudging the numbers so they can justify this mandatory mask/mail-in voting crap? They wouldn't do that....right? 😐 Well I think everyone should keep what happened to my friends grandpa in mind in case you know anyone that this has happened to also, maybe a second opinion in this case is called for? Just sayin'...."
Neutral,@GTMB,"I just joined Parler this week and I wanted to ask the community and patriots for their help. I lost my job last week. I’ve had a very difficult year, with the loss of my mother in January to cancer. I’ve already been struggling with my expenses and now I don’t know how I’m going to be able to make rent let alone be able to afford groceries by next month. If anyone can donate to  help me out and pay it forward. $5 or $10 or any amount would really help me out. God bless all of you.

Neutral,@CommunistCrusher,"So no one’s going to bring up the fact Joe Biden, on a live stream, said 120 million people died from covid-19, and the fact that it “freezed” after his yuuuuuge mistake?"
Neutral,@CommunistCrusher,I can’t wait for the MSM to tell us that the Trump Rally caused a spike in covid-19 knowing damn well we know those people aren’t taking your test. 😂👌🏼

Neutral,@JimLin,"I am sharing this I walked away about 2 weeks into this whole Coronovirus mess. I wasn’t a diehard democratic, but I felt those were the people I thought stood for we the people, and republicans were greedy, ruining this country. I was one of those people that hated Trump for the last 3 years. I called him a liar, an idiot, amongst many other things. I was convinced he was ruining this country. WOW was I wrong!!! One day I was watching Trumps daily virus briefing and something just clicked. He isn’t dumb or stupid, no he’s just not a politician, he’s just like you or me. He tells it like it is and truly cares about America. It was literally like a fog was lifted and I could see clearly, it was a weird felling. From there the researcher began and it felt like I opened Pandora’s box. Everything I knew and had been told, taught, and shown was bullshit! I can’t watch the nightly news anymore, was an old nightly tradition, the blatant lies and the skewed media reporting makes me sick now. I"
