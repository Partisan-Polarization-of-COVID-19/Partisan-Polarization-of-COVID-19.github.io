Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"And just like that, my Twitter account I’ve been working on every day for over 3 years is now gone. And they wouldn’t even give me a reason. Must have been hitting too close to home on the vaccines. But that’s okay. Nothing can stop what is coming. And nothing will stop me from waking up & continuing to expose these Deep State demons every single day until they are gone from our existence. 🌍🙏🏻💯 #WWG1WGA #DarkToLight #TheGreatAwakening #GodWins #PatriotsAreInControl #TrustThePlan #PanicInDC #Qanon #TheStormIsUponUs #NothingCanStopWhatsComing"

We are told how easily its passed on and how long it lives on surfaces. Why are they not being mandated to close periodically during the day for it? There’a more to this than we are being told, and hopefully we are told why soon."

Only the ultra rich globalists are making money. It's like they kept the stock market going so they could bet against the market and make billions.  All the while the media, Hollywood and companies are pushing this one world together global citizen bullshit."
