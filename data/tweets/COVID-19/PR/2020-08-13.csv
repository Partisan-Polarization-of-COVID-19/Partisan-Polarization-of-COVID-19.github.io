Look no further than how many are reacting to COVID right now judging, hurting and even killing people over masks. IF these bullies REALLY and truly believe that their non-approved masks work and they are wearing them thereby protecting themselves from harm, then why are they so fixated on bullying everyone else? Now even trying to eat a burrito, OUTSIDE on a bench can result in an unprovoked attack of hot coffee thrown in your face by a virtue signaling social justice warrior without a clue. Not satisfied with throwing hot coffee in the face of an unsuspecting man just trying to eat his lunch, this clueless sjw went a step further and when he leapt up in his own defense hit him repeatedly, then called the police to report HIM for an assault."

Neutral,@DeplorableDebutante,"Today I got my first ""Could you put your mask over your nose?"" From a young woman that looked the same as she smelled, in a large department store. Since she said it to my back, I felt no need to turn around when I said ""No."" sternly back to her, and from the indignant huffing and clapping I could hear behind me, it sounded as if she was never told No in her life. The trick, I found, was to immediately tell the associate you're working with that the person is making -you- feel unsafe. It sends them into a tailspin where they don't know what to do for fear of offending someone that may spin into a ""Viral moment"".  It's actually hilarious."
Neutral,@Imthinking,Lousiana Attorney General Jeff Landry declares Gov. Bell Edward's executive order mask mandate to be null and void over it's unconstitutional and vague wording. According to Landry the order would put many business owners in position of enforcement leading to civil liability lawsuits. Landry clearly demonstrated that the order was completely unenforceable and worded so badly that no one could be charged a fine therefore placing government officials in a position to be sued should they attempt to fine anyone. #Louisiana #ParlerUSA #Politics

Governments initiated it in WWI and it was so bad (Spanish flu) the fear of repeating lasted nearly 100 years.
