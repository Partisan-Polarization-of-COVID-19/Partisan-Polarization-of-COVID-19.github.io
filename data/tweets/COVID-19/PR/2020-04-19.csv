Negative,@Caballero,"States, Counties and cities who are using the Wuhan virus to clear out jails and prisons are doing a huge disservice to its citizenry. All in the name of safety for the convicted criminals who could “potentially” be infected. What a shame these criminals won’t do their full sentence. And what an injustice to those affected by the criminals. Criminals feel lucky....victims feel screwed. Public feels uneasy/unsafe."
