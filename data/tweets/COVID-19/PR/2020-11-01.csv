Negative,@FreeEarthlings,"Dr. #ReinerFuellmich on #PCRtestScandal  The #Covid19Crisis must be renamed a #CoronaScandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages. How dangerous is the virus? What is the significance of a positive #PCRtest? What is the collateral damage with respect to #health and #economy? An international network of lawyers will argue the biggest #TortCase ever - the #CoronaFraudScandal - which has unfolded into probably the greatest #CrimesAgainstHumanity ever committed. #Scientists and #lawyers recognise that as a result of the deliberate panic-mongering and the corona measures enabled by this panic, #democracy is in great danger of being replaced by #FascistTotalitarian models. To make sure that no one will ever again be in a position of such power as to be able to defraud humanity, or to attempt to manipulate us with their corrupt agendas. #SaveTheEconomy #DefendHumanity #EndLockdowns  #MakeLawLawfulAgain  #GetOffOurRights"
Positive,@Allenford1927,"Am i the only one who drives around and sees people everywhere wearing masks/faceshields even if their walking by themselves and feel like you're in an apocoliptic movie from the 80's? Like ""Maximum Overdrive"" or something? I just can't get used to this mask thing! Wear a mask if you feel like it's going help, but it is such a crazy deal to see it everywhere you go! It's a real life version of the movie ""Outbreak"" I'm waiting for Dustin Hoffman to come out of the woodwork wearing a hazmat suit somewhere in this! 😆"
Neutral,@gregyost7777,"Walmart allows BLM masks to be worn by employees, but they are not allowed to wear Trump masks."
Neutral,@FreeWillExpress,Doctors speak out against masks - YouTube
Neutral,@curtisfisher,The governor in Pennsylvaniaactually said you should wear masks in your home...hahahah.. ummm Ithought Gavin Newsome was a moron..well he is...but wow
Neutral,@Jayanne82,"I was just curious what the meaning of ""looking Presidential""eluded to. Is it walking on stage at the beginning of the last debate making the grand gesture of pulling off his mask when it could have been done BEFORE he entered or is it the demeaner of trust and confidence of a President who has not only made promises but also kept them. I would rather have a man like that even if his attire was bib overalls and dusty boots. I don't vote for ""looking Presidential""! I vote for a President I can trust. TRUMP!  🇱🇷 🇱🇷 🇱🇷 😘 🇱🇷 🇱🇷 🇱🇷 🇱🇷 🇺🇸 🇺🇸"
Neutral,@DiamondAndSilk,Diamond and Silk have a question. Did Pfizer take almost 2 Billion dollars of American tax dollars to make 100 Million doses of vaccines by the end of the year but now they can only deliver 25 Million doses and they plan to send half of those doses overseas? Did Americans get $h!tted by Pfizer?
Positive,@itskarleysmith,Instagram blocking ALL recent hashtags in order to “stop the spread of false information” before the election 🤬 chopping small business at the knees and censoring our means to get the TRUTH the MSM lies about! Unbelievable!
Negative,@angfunkwall,@elijahschaffer has got this right. Please take a few minutes and watch his podcast THE GREAT RESET. This smacked me right in the face.
Neutral,@Happysavage999,"Vitamin D is critical for body-wide functionality. Deficiency is an issue for the majority of people in the northern hemisphere. Especially from late fall to early spring, where the cold causes all of us to cover up and stay inside. #vitamind #vitamindeficiency #italy #covid19 #covidtreatment"
Neutral,@FaithFamilyFitness,"So Justin Turner took to the field to celebrate winning the World Series with his wife and teammates. Only problem was they found out he had COVID in the eight inning and pulled him from the game. Participating in the postgame celebration violated COVID rules. Wait, what? This player has been around his teammates in the preceding games and for almost the entire final game of the World Series. So somehow at the end of the game he was more infectious? What a bunch of crap. Let this man have his moment. The idiots questioning this have unlikely ever played sports at a high level and spend their lives as overpaid bureaucrats. Get a life and fire a neuron in those pea sized brains of yours."
Neutral,@FreeWillExpress,medical professionals sue Netherland Gov over covid scam
Neutral,@curtisfisher,Covid used as main election tampering tool..add in a software designer who is ultra lib..smh
Neutral,@blakeRenMan,"* SHOCKING * ⤵️  The Japanese professor of physiology or medicine, Professor Dr Tasuku Honjo, caused a sensation today in the media by saying that the corona virus is not natural. It is manufactured and the virus is completely artificial. I have been working for 4 years in the Wuhan laboratory in China. I know all the staff of this laboratory well. I called them all after the Corona accident. but, all of their phones have been dead for 3 months. It is now understood that all of these laboratory technicians are dead.  I can say this with 100% confidence that Corona is not natural. It did not come from bats. China made it. even after I die, the government can withdraw my Nobel Prize. but China is lying and this truth will one day be revealed to all."
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,So important to know this. This mRNA vaccine being pushed is not intended to cure a virus. It’s intended to alter our DNA.
