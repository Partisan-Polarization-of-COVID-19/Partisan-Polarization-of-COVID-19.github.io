Neutral,@Elizbritton,"What is my family doing to prepare for a possible pandemic. Lots of Vodka: disinfectant and pain relief. Surgical and first aid Kits: No brainer.  Vegetable seeds: non modified Water filtration: creek behind our house. Dehydrated and canned foods: packs of family size dehydrated soups are great.  Cooking capabilities: fill up those propane bottles. Buy a camp stove. There is no guarantee there will be utilities. Personal protection devices: if you get my drift. Family plan to combine resources and ideas: include protection plan from looters and unsavory types. Don’t live in a large city: if you do contact your second cousin bubba who hunts, fishes and growers his own food and beg him to let you stay with him. Otherwise your screwed.  Feel free to add to my list. The more ideas the better."
