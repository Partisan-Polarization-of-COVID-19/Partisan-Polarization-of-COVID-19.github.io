Neutral,@DonBaker71,I'm already tired of the 24/7 coronavirus news coverage. It's not the only thing happening in the world. No wonder we're having a crisis.
Neutral,@aJoeBlowe,"I blame Clinton, Bush, Obama for any 'slowing' in terms of our CDC response. I think our media and Dems are largely traitorous in their hearts. They don't like our country and they don't like patriots or anyone who even likes America. I think these people with the current circumstances are a clear and present danger to our country and should be dealt with as such."
