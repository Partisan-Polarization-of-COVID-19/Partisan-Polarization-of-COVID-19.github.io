Positive,@Antipolean,"What has #feminism given #women ? ☑️ Too #poor to have large #families. ☑️ When we DO have #children, we're too poor to stay at home, so we now entrust them to the state via #childcare, #kindergartens, #stateruneducation.  ☑️ House prices have skyrocketed in many countries. Thanks to #twoincomes being the norm, housing is now #lessaffordable than ever. ☑️ Most of us #work full time, often for low wages. No time for partners, children, friends, #community, #volunteering, personal hobbies. We're legions of #exhaustedwomen.  ☑️ We don't have the time or energy to cook, so we're fatter and sicker than our grandmothers were, with a shorter #lifeexpectancy than our mothers generation. #fatandsick  ☑️ We've been duped into believing that #hookupculture will make us happy, when the truth is that women derive real #happiness from deep, long-term, secure relationships with men.  #Feminism has failed women. It's time to throw it away.  #feminismiscancer #feminismsucks #antifeminism"

Positive,@DavidMagicwords,"SURPRISE, SURPRISE! Colleges like Berkeley are planning to set up bogus in-person “classes” to subvert President Trump’s order requiring international students to leave the US if they aren’t taking classes that require attendance. They want to have classes like “social distancing,” that would meet once every couple of weeks, and would be “taught” by  students. Some possible deterrent solutions:  1.) Prosecute for immigration fraud any student, faculty member or administrator who participates; 2.) Revoke or deny federally guaranteed student loans for any student or institution that participates; 3.) Deport any foreign student who participates in any such a fraudulent scheme, AND impose a lifetime ban on re-entry into the US; 4.) Impose an immediate moratorium on granting student visas for Chinese nationals, and citizens from countries hostile the US."

It is sneaky. It can spread when buying clothes at Kohl’s but not at Target. It is non-alcoholic. It can’t spread when you are buying beer.
