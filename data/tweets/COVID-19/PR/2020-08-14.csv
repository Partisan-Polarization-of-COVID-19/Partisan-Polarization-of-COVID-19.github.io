Negative,@JimJordan,"Things the Democrats want: -Open borders & closed churches -Open borders & closed schools -Open borders & closed businesses -Open borders & closed gun shops -Open borders & closed stadiums How about instead of reopening the border, we reopen America?"
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"An apartment complex in Ventura County, CA is locking their residents inside the building until all of them are tested for Covid. I called the number, was put on hold, & then eventually forwarded to voicemail. This is the dangerous slope we’ve been talking about - & it’s exactly what the Cabal wants. They don’t even have to mandate laws or draft legislation when landlords, banks, businesses, etc. will go along with the agenda & require this out of their tenants /customers. And what happens if 1 child tests positive in a public school setting? Will they lockdown that entire school until every kid is forcefully tested then shipped to a “quarantine facility” if positive? This is called tyranny & it never ends up well for us citizens. It’s time to wake up & fight for our God-given rights. #WWG1WGA"

Negative,@johnnypatriot1,"TRUMP CALLS MASKLESS FRIENDS PEACEFUL PROTESTERS AT GOLF CLUB PRESSER ,MEDIA LOSES IT . if you watched the presidents presser last night ' then you saw what i call perhaps one of trumps greatest troll hits on the media of all time ,he literally shoveled their own shit right back in their face .ofcourse you know how the media is utterly obsessed with masks ,so ofcourse a reporter just had to ask why trumps friends didn't have masks on ,trump says they are peaceful protesters ,the crowd exploded in applause and laughter ,but naturally the media and the left was completely triggered . it was a beautiful thing to behold . Then he ended the presser by calling out the corrupt fake news ,another pay per view moment .he has mastered the art of triggering the left and the fake news media ,and i for one love it ."
Neutral,@Gbalrt,"Months ago, I hated Trump and the right. They were the racist party. I wanted to wear my mask and protest BLM. I supported black lives matter, and I gained more knowledge on my white privileged and systematic racism, and how our system kept POC down. I kept researching, kept reading stories, kept having conversations. My research went so deep, my conversations were so detailed, it lead me down so many paths. I began to unravel the lies of the mainstream media. I began to learn how Trump has helped the black community, creating the lowest unemployment rates for not only them, but everyone. I learned about the funding he put into black communities. I learned that the Democratic Party, the essence of my being, created “systematic racism”, as well as uses buzz words to create a narrative. I learned that being forced to wear masks goes against our constitutional rights. I learned that CENSORSHIP IS THE FIRST STEP to destroying democracy. Democrats are destroying America. I walked away."

Voluntary will mean no travel, no benifits, and slowly add more and more until they get the non vaccinated to conform.  Its all about technology advancement, controlling & brainwashing the public to accept while keeping fallout to a minimum. The west will not fall behind on technology. Think about it. The rest of the world advances and the USA stays behind for “freedoms” while China and others surge way ahead. Not gonna happen.  All the information they have collected on us & billions of dollars doing so will not go to waste.  That’s the plan. EVERYTHING is a distraction. EVERYTHING.

Negative,@AgendaofLight,"I recently moved out of Seattle because it is such a steep state of decline. The cult of intersectionality has consumed the masses there. It’s been an intersection process to lose so many people I knew to the cult, some of them critical thinkers.

Neutral,@DTP1199,"I swear liberals have shorter memories than a goldfish 1) we’ve never had a pandemic before!  -we just had H1N1 2) America is racist!  -we elected a black president twice.  3) climate change is real!  -not a single prediction has ever come true.  4) Covid is trump’s fault!  -literally came from China  5) saying it came from China is racist!  -China is a country, not a race. 6) Trump is going to start WW3!  -literally has negotiated out of two wars including a 70 year stalemate."
Neutral,@DTP1199,"None of this is new.   This isn’t our first pandemic and definitely not our deadliest.   This isn’t our first round of race riots.   This isn’t the first time socialist revolutionaries have taken to the streets attacking buildings and police.   If we fight a revolution, it wouldn’t be our first.   If we fight a civil war between states, it wouldn’t be our first.   It’s just a new generation using the same old playbook.   Get young impressionable people addicted to porn, sex, drugs, alcohol etc.   Get them to not believe in God or any other higher power than government.   Remove patriotism to gain more followers or less enemies who’d fight for their country.   Preach power to the people but seize power and offices wherever you can at every level of government.   Exploit isolated events to appear bigger than they are.   Accuse the other side of that which you are guilty.   Keep people oppressed so you can control them."

Neutral,@Athealstan,My city is looking for social media influencers to spread the word that covid isn't cool. I will be very surprised if that works because they're options are onlyfans models and drag queens. Not people the general public would take seriously. Also.. it seems like they're having trouble getting influencers to do anything because there isn't any money. I wish scientists had bigger followings online.
Neutral,@Flyingrn,"If this does not catch your attention, I do not know what will. We are being played by the numbers, not by the virus. No COVID-19 test is FDA approved. It’s not the number of cases but the number of tests. Once you have a “positive“ test, you are required to go back and retest until you get a negative. Each positive test is being counted as a case, not a test. Wake up America. It’s a political game. #manipulatethemasses"
Neutral,@Demfools,"Planted this garden with my family. Was just laid off from my job, COVID hit, therapy was needed!! Giving thanks to my God and my President that the Cares Act was passed really helped get through what would have otherwise been a tough time. This first Sun Flower is a symbol of hope and faith!! In the past two weeks found a new job doing what I love. And a big thank you to the Trump administration for the financial help. Now he wants to help those who are still struggling and the Democrats won’t let him. To my friends still not working there is hope, your sunflower will bloom also. Support the man that wants to help us and your garden will shine two fold! November is very important for us all. President Trump is our Hope!! 🙏🙏🙏"

Neutral,@jk20,"I came to a conclusion today. I very strongly dislike China. Let me be specific: I very strongly dislike the Chinese Communist Party. I would go so far as to say I hate the CCP. I believe I’ve contracted their virus, and as a healthy young man, it has felt like a case of flu paired with severe dehydration. It has given me grief, wasted my time, and made this weekend feel like and entire week has passed, not to mention making 2020 in general pretty lame. I hope that my fellow Americans are as enraged as I am that the CCP has been coddled to and befriended by those in power in our very own country. If China is spoiling for a war I say we bring it to them before they try any more unwholesome underhanded schemes. I am completely fed up with the fear mongering, the shutting down of our country, with letting bad people get away with doing wrong just because they think they can. Everyone wants justice when they’ve been wronged, and I think it’s time China got theirs! #holdchinaaccountable"
