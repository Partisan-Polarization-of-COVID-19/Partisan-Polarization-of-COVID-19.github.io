I have been a nursing assistant for 10 years. All this time, the rules from the CDC was always throw away your PPE before leaving the patients room. Well now it is supposedly okay to wear them in every room! It is not right! Even with residents that do not have covid. This is how it gets spread. If we would had the proper PPE, we could change it out after every patient and it possibly wouldn't spread as bad. A lot of nursing homes dont want to spend the money on the PPE.  Also, we are supposed to quarantine the residents that have it. So what do you do if that resident doesn't want to listen and visit other residents in their rooms?
