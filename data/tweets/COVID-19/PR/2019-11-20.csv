Neutral,@BonnieE,"2019 Earmarks came out today This is only a few Congress spent: $65 million to help salmon $12 million to control aquatic plants $9 million to quarantine fruit flies $863,000 to eradicate tree snakes in Guam $17 million to ""Improving lives across Asia” Yet there wasn't enough for a Wall?"
Positive,@ConservativeLatina,"Let me see if I’ve got this right: Leftists say the age to obtain a gun to protect yourself with should be raised b/c young adults make poor & irrational decisions everyday & can’t be trusted with a “weapon of war.” BUT, we should lower the voting age to 16, b/c young adolescents can totally make rational & mature decisions about electing the right officials to represent the entire country. The fact that majority of these adolescents snort condoms & eat tidepods for fun & get triggered over differences of opinions shouldn’t be held against them.  AND, toddlers are mature enough to undergo a sex change & disagreeing with this idea makes you a total close-minded transphobic Nazi. I think I got it now. 👌🏽"
