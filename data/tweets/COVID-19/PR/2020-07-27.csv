Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"An apartment complex in Ventura County, CA is locking their residents inside the building until all of them are tested for Covid. I called the number, was put on hold, & then eventually forwarded to voicemail. This is the dangerous slope we’ve been talking about - & it’s exactly what the Cabal wants. They don’t even have to mandate laws or draft legislation when landlords, banks, businesses, etc. will go along with the agenda & require this out of their tenants /customers. And what happens if 1 child tests positive in a public school setting? Will they lockdown that entire school until every kid is forcefully tested then shipped to a “quarantine facility” if positive? This is called tyranny & it never ends up well for us citizens. It’s time to wake up & fight for our God-given rights. #WWG1WGA"

He worked in concert with various manufacturers to produce the much anticipated need for ventilators, and shipped them across the country to States that requested them along with whatever PPE equipment they needed. He enlisted the best medical experts he could find, consulted the WHO and CDC, and provided daily briefings, some of which were quite lengthy. He tried to encourage American citizens and quell the fear and panic which many were experiencing, assuring them everything was under control… simply meaning that everything that could be done was being done.

Neutral,@ClintKattine,"So let me get this straight: It’s okay for Bill Gates, who’s not a doctor, to come out and say you will need 2 COVID vaccines and they should go to blacks and people of color first. It’s okay for Democrat congressmen to call the Attorney General of the United States a murderer and insinuate he’s a racist. It’s okay for doctors on YouTube to describe the health benefits of eating a placenta. It’s okay for an actress to go on prime time television and proudly state that she wouldn’t be where she is today if she hadn’t aborted her infant. But it’s not okay for a group a board certified physicians from a diverse background to report on the benefits of medications that have been FDA approved for over 60 years and are statistically safer than aspirin?  And it’s more than just not okay, evidence of their entire internet existence must be deleted? Their videos deleted from existence and their website removed from the internet?

Neutral,@jgoff87,"We did that. And as it seemed that the first wave was past, President Trump mused aloud about a very tough decision he was going to have to make regarding opening the Country again, only to be brought up short with Liberal leaders telling him forcefully that it was not up to him, but up to the Governors in each State to do that. He said okay. You’re right. Do what you think best. And they did, some opening more than others. With all that to consider, when I watched the latest Joe Biden ad and saw their graph showing American COVID-19 infections rising to over 400,000 while other countries remained much lower, I just shook my head. We have more and better testing than other countries so yes, we have identified more cases. And if the spread is abnormally high, it is the individual Governors who should take that responsibility… they are the ones who decided what to open in their State and when."
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"An apartment complex in Ventura County, CA is locking their residents inside the building until all of them are tested for Covid. I called the number, was put on hold, & then eventually forwarded to voicemail. This is the dangerous slope we’ve been talking about - & it’s exactly what the Cabal wants. They don’t even have to mandate laws or draft legislation when landlords, banks, businesses, etc. will go along with the agenda & require this out of their tenants /customers. And what happens if 1 child tests positive in a public school setting? Will they lockdown that entire school until every kid is forcefully tested then shipped to a “quarantine facility” if positive? This is called tyranny & it never ends up well for us citizens. It’s time to wake up & fight for our God-given rights. #WWG1WGA"

Também tivemos a sanção do marco do saneamento básico no Brasil. Na próxima década, poderemos ter 100% da população brasileira com água tratada e esgoto. Para isso, é essencial privatizar as estatais responsáveis pelo serviço que hoje é prestado.  Hoje, foi um bom dia."
Neutral,@ClintKattine,"So let me get this straight: It’s okay for Bill Gates, who’s not a doctor, to come out and say you will need 2 COVID vaccines and they should go to blacks and people of color first. It’s okay for Democrat congressmen to call the Attorney General of the United States a murderer and insinuate he’s a racist. It’s okay for doctors on YouTube to describe the health benefits of eating a placenta. It’s okay for an actress to go on prime time television and proudly state that she wouldn’t be where she is today if she hadn’t aborted her infant. But it’s not okay for a group a board certified physicians from a diverse background to report on the benefits of medications that have been FDA approved for over 60 years and are statistically safer than aspirin?  And it’s more than just not okay, evidence of their entire internet existence must be deleted? Their videos deleted from existence and their website removed from the internet? No, we’re not in Communist China. This is the U.S."
Neutral,@ClintKattine,"The Democrat Party is the party of victims. For them to win, they have to get as many victims to show up on Election Day as possible. America is systematically racist, so blacks are a victim. COVID is out of control and it’s Trumps fault, so you’re a victim. Republicans are trying to take away your abortion rights. You’re a victim. Republicans hate gays and oppose gay marriage. You’re a victim. Republicans think men are men and women are women, violating your “trans rights.” You’re a victim. Donald Trump made fun of a disabled person. You’re a victim. You don’t work and don’t have money but the rich people have money. You’re a victim. Democrats will use this coalition of victims to take rights away in the name of curing victimhood, but their real objective is conquest. The conquest of conservatism. They want to bring us to our knees so we can no longer stand in the way of their absolute power. They want to change America into a socialist nation with them as the hand that feeds."

Neutral,@Eyerishluv,"I implore all #conservatives and #libertarians to begin to take an active role in boycotting these companies, universities, and cities who don’t share our views. We are being fully dismissed cause We’re the adults and typically don’t like to speak up or protest cause we’re too busy making America the great country it is by working and providing jobs. But this mentality has to stop, our country is going down a bad path based on false narratives that get echo’d by legitimate govts and companies cause the loud voices get first seat at the table. We MUST start to push back in a more significant way and the best way to implement Change is to start sticking to strict boycotts. Don’t give your kids money to watch liberal sports or entertainment, don’t put your kid into a liberal college, you can stop their support too they’re doing with your money. We need to start now, we’ve been losing for awhile now due to social media and it’s evident with how Corona, Rioters, have been handled."
