Positive,@Groveshard,"Donald Trump has STATED: “I Love the poorly educated .... “ This is because those without critical thinking skills can be manipulated into thinking that, because he despises the same people as they, he will help them ~ Idiocy ! He doesn’t GAS about anyone ~ even if they vote for him ! Who knew there were enough strategically located Racists in voter-suppressed states to get the Electoral College votes to elect Donald Julep Jacamo JerriLynn Jessica JoJo Juniperberry Jeanine Janice Jee yer Hair Smells Terrific Juanita Jocelyn Joyce Jillian Joanne JuJuBee Jennifer JoEllen Janney Jeremiah was a Bullfrog Trump ? I hope they all stay home this year or hop on buses to the polls with a carelessly coughing COVID-19 driver and are stricken with the ‘Rona on the way to the polls and are too sick to vote upon arrival. Eh ?"
Neutral,@BlakeHoughton,I see some antisemitism on here and I know some of these people also think the virus and lockdowns are a Jewish plot. How's the cognitive dissonance feel I wonder?

Neutral,@Groveshard,"Hey, y’all ... I’ve voted Absentee for local, state, and federal candidates in Fitchburg, Wisconsin, where my wife and I own property and from which we pay local, state, and federal taxes. Our ballots’ arrival in Fitchburg has been communicated to us by the City Clerk’s office. We also own property in Austin, Texas, where my we have been for over 6 months due to the SARS-CoV-2 virus’ airborne pervasiveness and very contagious nature. We’ve been afraid to fly home under circumstances found on most flights. We finally found flights that will allow us the maximum isolation from others in the cabin so we’re flying home in late October. My question comes from a desire to vote in Austin’s many local and state elections for those who can affect our property’s value, and for US Senator. Is it possible to vote in Texas without voting a second time for our choice of Presidential candidates ?"

Neutral,@HillaryClinton,"Imagine if I was the President, which I should be since I won the popular vote in 2016. Coronavirus would be long behind us, and I would be heading into the 2020 election poised to beat some lame republican.
