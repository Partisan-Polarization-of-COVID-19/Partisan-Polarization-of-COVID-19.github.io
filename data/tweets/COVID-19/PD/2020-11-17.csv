Neutral,@DeniseMcAllister,"COVID: a 0.06 percent death toll.  This is NOT a national emergency. The mandates, orders, masks, separations and lockdowns are abuses of power in response to a virus that is an extremely LOW death rate and toll on the country.  The response has one goal: government management of the US economy and control of the American people."

Negative,@demochris,"For those opposed to mask mandates, are you also opposed to government seatbelt mandates? Should car manufacturers be compelled to install air bags? Why or why not? #masks #nomasks #governmentmandates #masksoff"
Negative,@0mnipresent,Hey #covid19 #covid #covid19hoax #covidhoax #antimask #antimasker #antimaskers I have a message for you:
Neutral,@0mnipresent,"Wear your masks properly motherfuckers, 1000 Americans are dying every day."
Neutral,@FlushedTheTurd,Trump just pulled out the worst of the party and gave them a voice. They no longer mask hatred of anybody that's not as terrible as them.

Negative,@besticando,Donald Trump has repeatedly called the Coronavirus the China Virus or the kung-flu. That kind of language breeds racism and xenophobia.
Neutral,@Freemedicare4all,"I live in japan and we started the pandemic around the same time and man... America did not handle it well... “there are more people in America” the population density of America is 35 people per Km squared. In japan it’s 347 people per km squared. Litter ally the population density is 100 times more in japan, yet there are less cases. 😩😩アメリカから来ましたんですけど日本に住んでいます。日本には35-40日の封鎖されていました。それですから日本の感染者数と死亡者数は大丈夫なんです。アメリカもはするべきなんですけど、頑固人がいっぱいんですから大変でしょう。バイデン次期大統領に頑張ってください。下ではアメリカと日本の違いなんですよ。日本には毎日人がソーシャルディスタンスをして、マスクをかけますよ。"
Neutral,@0mnipresent,I’ve been seeing this #covid19 #misinformation going around here. This is a debunking from DrKatEpidemiologist on TikTok. Maybe stop sharing false info?
Neutral,@DoseOfReality,I guess congrats to the White House for finding something they’re successful at. 😷 #presidentelectbiden #joebiden #maga #trump2020 #qanon #voterfraud #stopthesteal #covid19
Neutral,@HelenDale,"For the curious, here's my complete spot with Mike Graham on @talkRADIOuk this morning. In short: when it comes to COVID-19, state capacity matters more than ideology, sex, or even science-based policy."
Neutral,@HelenDale,"COVID-19 has really shown which countries can run things. And that skill is nothing to do with your favourite ideology, sex, or preferred scientific approach. The thing that matters is /running things/. Me in CapX magazine banging the state capacity drum & asking awkward questions."
