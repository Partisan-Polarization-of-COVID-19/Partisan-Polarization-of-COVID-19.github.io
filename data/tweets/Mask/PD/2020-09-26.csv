Negative,@angrygaybitch,"Yall say wearing a mask is the government taking away your rights, which is the most dramatic shit I've ever heard in my life. Wearing a cloth on your face for 20 minutes isn't the equivalent to your rights being taken away you piss hole. AND AFTER SAYING THAT BULLSHIT, YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO CALL US SNOWFLAKES FOR STANDING UP FOR HUMAN RIGHTS- Ah yes, fuck human rights, the masks we wear for twenty minutes that are protecting the people around us are the problem. How about you take Trumps dick out of your mouths for a minute and think for yourself, instead if blindly following the bunker bitch. ðŸ˜˜ #only2genders #trump2020 #alm #alllivesmatter #blm #blacklivesmatter #pride #lgbt #drumptrump #genz #genztakeover #ftrump #trumpinagrave2020 #trumpinacasket2020 #trans #transgender #nonbinary #acab #libtard #snowflake #mask #wearamask #nomasks #1312"
