Positive,@HappilyFormerRepublican,"I know nobody on this platform will listen, but I'd implore you anyway. Don't do this march in D.C. today. There is a very strong likelihood that the event will be a COVID super-spreader. You have an opportunity to save the lives of your friends and families with this simple decision. If you go anyway, please at least make a serious effort to social distance and wear a mask. Yes, I voted for Biden, but I don't anyone on either side of the aisle to be ravaged by this disease. Stay safe for all of us. #millionmagamarch #Trump2020 #Coronavirus #StaySafe"
