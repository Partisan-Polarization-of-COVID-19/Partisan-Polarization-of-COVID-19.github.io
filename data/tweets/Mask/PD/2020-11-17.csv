Neutral,@DeniseMcAllister,"COVID: a 0.06 percent death toll.  This is NOT a national emergency. The mandates, orders, masks, separations and lockdowns are abuses of power in response to a virus that is an extremely LOW death rate and toll on the country.  The response has one goal: government management of the US economy and control of the American people."

Negative,@demochris,"For those opposed to mask mandates, are you also opposed to government seatbelt mandates? Should car manufacturers be compelled to install air bags? Why or why not? #masks #nomasks #governmentmandates #masksoff"
Negative,@0mnipresent,Hey #covid19 #covid #covid19hoax #covidhoax #antimask #antimasker #antimaskers I have a message for you:
Neutral,@0mnipresent,"Wear your masks properly motherfuckers, 1000 Americans are dying every day."
Neutral,@FlushedTheTurd,Trump just pulled out the worst of the party and gave them a voice. They no longer mask hatred of anybody that's not as terrible as them.
