Positive,@damannywillnotbetelevised,wear a mask please
Positive,@GoJoeBiden,"Too many Americans have fetishized the concept of freedom. What they define as ""freedom"" is the license to behave recklessly & dangerously without any consequence.  That is not freedom - it's anarchy. And that is not America. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡² Wear a mask."
Positive,@formerdemocrat,"Fauci testified this morning about how important it is to wear a mask because â€œwe should all care about one anotherâ€œ. I always wear mine. But this is the problem with the D party tearing us apart since Trump won. Itâ€™s what I always feared. When it comes to a national crisis such as the Covid pandemic, theyâ€™ve created a country that doesnâ€™t care about one another anymore. so his logic falls apart. It all started with them calling half the nation racist. Doesnâ€™t really foster a feeling of unity, right?"
Neutral,@Artybarbie,"If a mask mandate is an infringement of rights, why is controlling a uterus a function of government? Asking for a friend."
Neutral,@ihateamericaandtrump,donâ€™t forget to wash your hands every day and practice safe social distancing! ðŸ¥°âœ¨ always wear masks :) echo this to remind people! ðŸ˜Œâœ¨
