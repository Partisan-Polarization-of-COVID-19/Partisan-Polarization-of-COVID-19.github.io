Neutral,@CoolCat4America,That is not 'routine error'. It is quite significant and not acceptable. Just imagine how those incorrect test results temporarily disrupted so many people's lives - causing anxiety and the need to quarantine from family and friends.
Positive,@DianaCollier,This is so funny! I'm going to give everyone I see with a mask on that look.

Negative,@F0RtheRepublic,"Who is with me! Let them know that we will no longer follow this Tyrannical unconstitutional mask mandate!! We should have done it months ago, maybe then we could have saved our amazing economy and prevented so many people from losing their jobs! Let's take a stand together and take these rediculous masks off!! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡² Let's get America back up and running again!"
Neutral,@A2ndOpynyn,"Explains all the masked assholes burning down leftist cities, doesn't it?"
Neutral,@Fenway02215,The mask has come off on the Marxists. Itâ€™s time to fight back!
Neutral,@AppleJax,Hunt for â€˜attacker who stabbed senior citizen in the FACE for not wearing a COVID maskâ€™
Neutral,@Evaluation,"BIDEN VOTER on PLANE TELLS VETERAN ""You Should have DIED in AFGHANISTAN"" Just because He is Wearing a MAGA MASK!"
Neutral,@ByronYork,"On coronavirus, it looks like official Biden-Harris policy will be a National Mask Suggestion. ('It's a standard -- nobody's going to be punished. Come on.') That seems to be pretty much the situation today. From NBC:"
Neutral,@DBHooey,"You wonâ€™t see this reported in the media nationally. It is too much good news. If almost half a million people can gather for an event that spans 10 days with this outcome, it puts their COVID-19 panic porn to rest. The case for mail-in voting would die. We could conduct a safe and secure election as usual. People could go back to work and school without screening tests or masks. And college football would be a go nationwide."
