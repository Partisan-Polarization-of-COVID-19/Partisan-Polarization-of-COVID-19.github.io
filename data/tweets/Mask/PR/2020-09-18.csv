Negative,@BaseballDC,Walk into a store with no mask. Nobody even noticed.
Negative,@BlackLion,Patriots need to stop being p***ies and just open up their businesses and stop wearing masks on their own. The mayor's and governors can't do a damn thing about it if we did.
Neutral,@Andreatoman,Enough is enough! It's time to give up our masks and live as free people. #freedomispopular
