Positive,@dryan7,Pelosi to Host Large Dinner for New House Members as Democrats Urge Americans To Stay Home and Not Host Family Gatherings Due to Coronavirus
Positive,@Jeanna929017376560,As a COVID survivor I really have mixed emotions on this. I wear a mask to protect myself because I don‚Äôt ever want to be that sick again. I can‚Äôt stay home. I have to work and buy groceries. So I have to be out and about. I honestly don‚Äôt know what the answer is on all of this.
Positive,@BeliveInAmerica,"We cannot let these animals run the streets of America. When we have a rally we need to show up like they do. Conservatives showing up for a peaceful demonstration, must be prepared to defend each other or don‚Äôt have a rally, stay home and take your medicine. We cannot stand for a single fellow demonstrator being attacked by the gang of cowards and basement dwellers, the exact reason Lunch Bucket Joe identifies with them. We are Americans, that used to mean something to all of us."
Positive,@Candice23,I think people should only vote if they have a job or cannot have a job (due to disability or other circumstances). Of course being a stay at home mom or dad counts as a job! You all know what I mean by government handouts and people that just don‚Äôt do anything and still get money off the government.
Positive,@191powm,"President-elect Joe Biden has floated a nationwide lockdown and mask mandate in response to surging coronavirus cases across the country. But even if he follows through and orders all Americans to stay at home and cover their faces when in public, don‚Äôt expect to see those mandates enforced in South Dakota. The office of Gov. Kristi Noem said in a statement to the Argus Leader Friday that the first-term governor, who‚Äôs risen to stardom in the Republican party for her hands-off approach to managing the pandemic, has no intention of using state resources to enforce any federal COVID-19 orders."
Neutral,@AbbyJohnsonOfficial,"It‚Äôs time for every church in America to defy lockdown, quarantine and any other orders related to this virus. People need to be in Church. They need to fellowship with other believers. They NEED hope. They need Jesus. Stop cowering to the government. Stand up and fight."

Neutral,@Army79,"In June Fort Benning did everything necessary to prevent COVID-19 spread. They quarantined recruits 14 days, tested and retested after 14 days. Wore masks even while sleeping. Still recruits were infected after another test a week or 2 later. So this study is no surprise."
Neutral,@Bonita,"Marches or Car rallies are being held all over California. If we leave California, Gov Newsom says we have to self quarantine. But we have people living in Mexico who cross every day into San Diego because that‚Äôs where they work. 22% of new cases in the county were spread by those is what county officials said. We are on the most restrictive tier now for at least 3 weeks."

Neutral,@DiamondAndSilk,Governors do not have the right to take away freedoms by choosing lockdowns for Americans instead of allowing Americans to make their own choice with therapeutic medicines or a vaccine!

Positive,@Clinton614,"I know what you're thinking.... I have a family, children, a job, and good credit, I can't get involved with a civil war. Well dammit, I have just as much as any of you have to lose, but if we don't get off our asses and take back our country, none of us are going to have a damn thing anyways. I'm not going to be forced to wear a mask I'm not going to shut down my business I'm not going to be forced to take a vaccine I'm not going to pay double the taxes I'm not going to pay the price for open borders I'm not going to share my wealth with the lazy I'm not going to pay health care for anyone who wants to comes to our country I'm not going to get rid of the things we enjoy that takes gasoline Are you?  #clinton614"

Neutral,@Davidinloes,"We are wearing masks almost everywhere, at the same time the growth in the virus spread has grown. Masks do nothing!!"
Neutral,@Freevortex1,"I for one am sick and tired of seeing and hearing this idiot! The masks do not work! We measure small particles in microns and nanometers typically. A micron is 1/25,400ths of an inch, a nanometer is 1/1000000000 meters. Dust mites and allergens are 0.1 to 100 nanometers. The gift we were given from Asia is 60-140 nanometers, for the piece I will not split the baby and will use 0.1 micron as the size of this virus because particulate matter in the 0.1 micron size act more like a gas than a particle (hold your breath). A mask does not work!"

NO ONE WILL BELIELVE OR ACCEPT THAT OLD RAISEN THAT HAS DONE NOTHING IN 47 YEARS, AND WANTS TO LOCK US DOWN AND MASK US, FORCE VACCINES ON US, AND PUT PEOPLE IN CAMPS IF THEY OPPOSE....THAT THE HELL DO YOU CALL THAT."
Neutral,@Acidfast1,"Masks have never worked, but that was clear when they mandated them. Mandates are ANTI-SCIENCE. False Sense of Security only magnifies. If you are high risk, CLEAN hands before touching mouth, nose, eyes. Simple. Move on! If not for censorship & political/media lies, we would be back to normal life by now."

Neutral,@Ericmcpeek,"The main thing that I would worry about CONVID-19 in Coronavirus is just the number of deaths. Most people (around 99%), and I am now one of them have little or no symptoms and survive. It's things like that would not disturb me no matter the amount of active or past cases that we have. In fact, we know who would be in an at risk group and would most likely to suffer severe conditions or even death (elderly 65 years old and those with certain health conditions that weaken the immunity system) and there are simple measures out there that would make a lockdown so unnecessary. Those would include mask wearing for all and staying home or limiting time outside by keeping away from high risk areas)."
Neutral,@DorianHoward,"We are watching the greatest social experiment in history....not just in our lifetime....EVER. The convergence of a full-on attack on one man (thereby attack on us) by social media, foreign powers, people at the highest levels of our nation, ""stars"" in the entertainment industry and leaders in the Silicon Valley or high tech industry....is a social experiment that succeeded --for those behind the experiment--beyond anything we could or obviously would (for many people) believe. It's crazy how the ""powers that be"" literally caused mass hysteria over a supposed pandemic--less risky than the flu--caused mass testing, masking, isolation. Yet, we never once did these things for the flu--or ANY virus before. It's just as crazy how these powerful people also used all their resources, planning well ahead, to hate our President while also convincing the general public JoeB won the election. Yet...no legal declaration has been made. The resource for declaring the winner? The media.  The same"
