Neutral,@cherylRwalker,"If you’ve noticed, many state Governors are basing lockdowns on the percentage of ICU hospital beds being filled for determination of keeping us shut down. Has anybody noticed most ICU‘s only have a small number of units to start with? Especially in rural areas. So when it’s said, “Hospital ICU capacity is 90%,” it probably means 4 of the 5 beds available have been taken."
Neutral,@Joeoltmann,"For such a time as this... 2021 is the year of courage and resolve. It is the year of Patriots and truth. We will not allow the evil to destroy our country and enslave our people. If you do not think that is what they are trying to do, you are not paying attention. They are trying to weaken us as a nation from within... just a bit about their agenda: Abortions to destroy minority communities. “Gender fluidity” to destroy strength in men.  Socialism and communism pitched openly and frequently as if we should abandon opportunity and embrace mediocrity  Rhetoric of redistribution of wealth.  Mob rule... democracy, abandoning the very essence of what we truly are, a constitutional republic.  No police, no accountability and no consequences... followed by massive increases in violent crimes while leaders do nothing.  Lockdowns, killing over 200 million worldwide. This is just a taste of the leftist agenda... now we stand.  Happy New Year. Remember, God is at the wheel as we fight."

Negative,@Goldygirl,"Why can’t my restaurant open fully but grocery Walmart, Kroger and Home Depot are safe?  As I take a cart, that has had just the handle sanitized, I think about the money I’ve spent on ink and paper for disposable menus so no two guests touch the same menu. As I walk over to the produce aisle with 15-20 other people around me, I’m reminded of the strict 6ft distance between tables which has cut our capacity in half. As I check out at the cashier, I use my debit card to pay, the terminal is covered in dirty unsanitizer plastic. I have to use sanitizer on the debit terminals in between each guest every time at my restaurant. As I leave I watch dozens of unmasked people leaving at the same time, no distancing and I wonder how MY industry is getting blamed and being punished for this??  You want to blame restaurants for the spread after thousands of dollars investing in equipment, training and stricter policies than ANYWHERE ELSE?! PROVE 👏🏻 IT 👏🏻 #saverestaurants"
