Negative,@FreeEarthlings,"#NurembergCode #CodigoNuremberg Examine our ability to address the ethical challenges of our time. Addressing scientific misconduct downstream to medical research, particularly when biased interpretations of clinical studies lead to an over-optimistic assessment of a new drug, which ends up being withdrawn from the market after harming many individuals. Ethics must reconcile 2 antagonistic objetives which is a tough balancing act: - Protecting research subjects from possible harm. - Ensuring non-discriminatory access to research for potential subjects. The Nuremberg Code evokes a dark time for medicine, yet remains a powerful symbol in inspiring the medical profession to stand up for its #Hippocratic values & protect individuals from harmful experiments. In a context of relentless competition for resources among scientific institutions, #EthicalVigilance is a PERMANENT NECESSITY.  #MakeLawLawfulAgain #EndLockdowns #BreathingIsLife #GetOffOurRights  #MakeHealthHealthyAgain"

Neutral,@CraigTheTechTeacher,"""The study found that treated patients were 84% less likely to be hospitalized than untreated ones. Of 141 treated patients, four were hospitalized, which was significantly fewer than 58 of 377 untreated patients who were sent to the hospital. Additionally, the mortality rate for treated patients was lower. Only one patient in the treatment group died versus 13 patients in the untreated group. The patient who died had a history of cancer and only took one daily dose of the triple therapy before hospital admission."" #News #FakeNews #MSM #Media #SocialMedia #Politics #ArmyForTrump #COVID #COVID19 #Shutdowns #Trump"

Positive,@DrFootsie,MASK Up - It's the LAW - Who is this Masked Scumbag pretending to be the 2nd coming of Hippocrates - who carries a LONG SILVER BULLET and wants you to Bend Over and Take It Like A Man - NEVER EVER COMPLY
Positive,@DaveRPh,"Time to ditch the masks.   Why are people still wearing masks? Their is no scientific reason to do so.  The reasons are: 1. People want to be part of the 'group' and look 'clinical'.  2. Crafters are all in with the newest 'mask making' projects. 3. People know they don't work but are afraid to stand up for their Constitutional rights. 4. There is massive intimidation coming from the Democrats, who are using masks as the first step in obedience training.  5. People are making $ millions from masks and they control the false narrative that masks work. If masks really stop the spread of COVID you would hear TV commercials making this claim...they don't."

Positive,@DaveRPh,There is no proof that masks work. There is no proof that social distancing works. There is proof that washing your hands is beneficial. Be sure you wash your hands after throwing your mask in the trash. Now go out and play with your friends.
