Positive,@DashRiprock,"Many of the same people who are demanding that I wear a mask to keep them healthy, will eat a Bacon Double Cheeseburger & Fries for lunch today. üò∑üçîüçü"
Positive,@HopeSprings,"Governor Kristi Noem (R-SD) has been the only Governor in America that has gotten it right. Not only has she left wearing a mask up to the individual, she never shut her state down, or even the buinesses in her state. She even stands at the South Dakota State Captiol, everyday, no matter the weather, and prays over her state, and then walks the halls of the South Dakota state capitol and prays over every legislator's office, and elected official, that God will guide them and help them make the right desicions. South Dakota is in the best shape and condition than any other state in our nation. Governor Noem is a true constitutionalist! She is an example and an inspiration to us all! Copied. Cause it should be said, known and shared all across this country that Gov. Noem is exactly the kind of leader every politician should strive to be!!"
Negative,@AlDubya,Without face we don't exist as independent beings. The child looks in the mirror between the ages of two and three and is discovered as an independent being. The mask is the beginning of deleting individuality. #masksareforslaves #takeoffthemasks #nomasks #saynotomasks
Neutral,@Graniaom,"More positive evidence for in person voting :  At the DNC convention (East, Wilmington DE) Everyone must get a Covid test provided on site to be inside the secure perimeter. All very orderly, waiting in line, six feet apart, wearing masks and being tested. You know, lined up like people casting their vote :)"
