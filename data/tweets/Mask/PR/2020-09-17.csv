Negative,@IDTX,"Responding to a message on Trump’s “Failure”:  Of those 180K dead, how many came from Jersey, NY, and other blue states where the nursing home policies killed tens of thousands of elderly citizens needlessly?  Trump shut down international Travel from China in January, back when Pelosi went in the news with no mask & was telling everyone to not worry and come down to China town! It’s just a stunt!  Trump promoted HCQ back in March when tests showed efficacy, and now, 6 months later, countries who use it are reporting great results.  There were more manufacturing jobs created under Trump The Black unemployment dropped to lowest levels in decades The First Steps Act released thousands of wrongly imprisoned minorities and started them in rehab & trade training.  Qualified Opportunity Zones have sent billions of private dollars to underserved and impoverished areas of the country to develop and help them come out of the cycle.  He’s actually fulfilling campaign promises #trump2020"

Negative,@AustinIsAwake,Stop wearing masks! The people have the power. #thepeoplehavethepower
Neutral,@JakeStelmach,"Why don’t we all go to our local stores at least once without a mask and see what happens (unless you’re actually sick, then wear one). I did today in California and was not admonished by anyone. #nomaskchallenege"
Neutral,@JamesOtis76,"That’s about stupid, especially when the CDC has already told us that 75% of positive cases wore their mask all the time. This is about control. Not happening anyhow considering Biden’s media win means absolutely nothing. Biden is the President elect just as much as anyone is"
Neutral,@Eyeballs,"Where was all this enthusiasm at the voting booths? For months the Left complained and whined about how unsafe it was to vote in person, dispite social distancing, mask requirements and safety protocols. Yet when the media declares Biden victorious, magically, all that fear evaporates. Mail in ballots were never necessary. In fact, they were a coup to steal the Presidency. This is proof of that."
Neutral,@DoingRight1,US veteran quits his job after being told he can’t wear an American flag as a mask.
