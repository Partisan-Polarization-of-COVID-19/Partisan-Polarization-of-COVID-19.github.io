Negative,@Ferolids,Why is it okay for clerks in stores to work but not teachers? #endtheshutdown
Neutral,@andweknow,10.2.20: TEN days of DARKNESS/Quarantine? RED OCTOBER! Watch here:
Neutral,@billsfan1972,"Fuck Andrew Cuomo. I am furious. This dude is killing my grandmother and her own daughters cannot see her, because they live in states that have a mandatory 14 quarantine. They cannot even hug her or say goodbye, unless it is through a glass. This is so unfair. She is dying."
Negative,@Curls6,#unmaskamerica #covid19
Negative,@Jimtdavis,"WTF #QANON. At this point, with no indictments, all of this has been total bullshit. #unmasking #Flynnunmaskingscandal"
Negative,@Ddwhitleyavenger,Covid is incredibly smart. If you are unmasked while entering and/or leaving a restaurant it may attack but may not affect you while you're eating. Wow!
Neutral,@FredFigglehorn,Burn the masks!
Neutral,@Footballpopemd,"""The mask"" gives the Democrat apes an easier way to get close to you as they fuck you around."
Neutral,@HandyDanny,Happy 6 month anniversary to when this same man told us not to wear a face mask.... #cdc #covid19 #facemasks
Neutral,@Audax0,"The one good thing about this mask thing at work (and literally the ONLY GOOD THING) is that it gives me about 20% protection from the carnage in the bathrooms, which some days is, I'm pretty sure, the difference between survival and death."
Neutral,@IslandGirl75,"Today is the day for us ALL to throw way that nasty, germ-fill ‚ÄòPetri dish‚Äô we call a mask & starting living life like normal people. We all know the #cdc lied to us all about the actual deaths numbers of #covid19 . Only 6% of the WORLD‚ÄôS üåç population died from this virus. That‚Äôs just over 9,000 people...what the heck. Take that make off, breath the fresh air & lets start seeing our faces & smiles again! Six months of this garbage is too long! Let‚Äôs start educating our neighbors & friends & store owners on the REAL truth, it‚Äôs time . . ."
