Neutral,@JmcCaldwell,Here's why masks don't work. The covid particle is 0.1 microns. The fabric/surgical masks are somewhat defensive against 5 micron particles. A N-95 mask is defensive against 0.3 microns. We are just wearing germ factories on our face.

Neutral,@ChristianEl,Think about this... In a pretend world where Trump was 100% all in on science and public health and the “liberals” thought covid was all bullshit...  MAGA would all be mask people and acting shocked if anyone said their precious children needed to come back to school.  Crazy.
Neutral,@Fostermonster,"Our Demonrat mayor in Kansas City just extended our mask mandate until January 16, 2021. He is drunk on power and I guarantee we will not spend one cent in this city. Need to move the hell out of this city. Tell me this bs isn’t politically motivated. TRUMP 2020 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸"
