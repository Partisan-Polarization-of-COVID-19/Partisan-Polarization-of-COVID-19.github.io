Positive,@carpedonktum,"No matter what happens on Tuesday, I want to thank President Trump and all of you for providing me with all of the amazing opportunities and experiences over the last 4 years. I never could have dreamed that a stay at home dad from Kansas, making videos in his spare time could be so blessed as I have. From being invited to the White House, to traveling around the country, and being elevated to a position where I could reach 273,000 people on Twitter, 231,000 people on Parler, 54,000 people on youtube, 51,000 people on Facebook, and 38,000 people on Instagram. Thank you and I love you all. I am the luckiest guy in history."
Neutral,@ISecede,From Kirstie Alley:  The weird thing is assisted living staffs go home to their families who aren’t quarantined and THEY aren’t quarantined. They grocery shop & see friends. So why can’t family members mask up and see their loved ones in the same assisted homes? There is 100% NO difference. Cruel
Neutral,@Alegnab,Excellent speech on the high costs of Covid lockdowns:
Neutral,@JimJordan,Republicans:  Liberty. Not lockdowns.  Freedom. Not socialism.  Opportunity. Not mandates.

Neutral,@Badmike72,"I don’t know who needs to hear this, but wearing a mask doesn’t protect anyone from any virus. The CDC reported that 85% of those infected with the virus, wore a mask. Let’s refer to the 1918 flu pandemic. We know that approximately 675,000 people died in the US. What’s not reported is that most of those deaths were from bacterial pneumonia and not the flu according to the NIH. CDC spoke out about not wearing same masks in the wild fire areas because they don’t work. Did you know that the virus molecule is substantially smaller than a smoke molecule? If masks aren’t effective against smoke, they aren’t effective against the virus. If you need real proof of masks and how/what to use them appropriately, check out OSHA website. Those people that are trained in masked situations in the work place have spoken out against wearing masks as CDC recommended. IT IS ALL ABOUT CONTROL. Nothing based in science."
Neutral,@JimHutchinson,"Biden Memory Loss! Biden claims he’ll save the American people from Covid because he has a better plan; Fact 1: The Obama/Biden Administration completely depleted the National Stockpile of PPE during their 8 year term. Obama canceled testing for H1N1 after stockpile was depleted stating “Testing only shows numbers of infected and not how treatment is affecting cases.” Stockpile was never rebuilt so Trump had nothing to work with.  Fact 2: When George W Bush was President he compiled a panel of experts to study the effects of viruses and pandemics affecting other countries and to make a guideline for the US government to follow to best combat a pandemic in the US.  Many in the government said it was a waste of money. When presented to the Obama Administration after President Bush left office, it was dismissed as unnecessary because the US medical infrastructure and medical expertise could combat any virus making a pandemic very unlikely.  Now Joe has a plan? Bullshit!!!!"
