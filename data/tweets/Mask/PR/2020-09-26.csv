Positive,@GavinMcInnes,"I think one of the best takes on all this rioting and bratty behavior is Paul Joseph Watson pointing out this the daycare generation all grown up.

Neutral,@AussieG,I don‚Äôt know my country anymore. üòû A pregnant woman arrested for a Facebook post. Served a warrant to search and seize property in her home. Charged with incitement for organising a peaceful protest in her neighbourhood against these draconian lockdowns in Melbourne. This is not the Australia I grew up in or voted on you. Shame on you all.  #melbournelockdown #melbourne #wwg1wga
Neutral,@AdamJohnson,"Okay, my take on #Salongate . Nancy Pelosi has been mostly in San Francisco for the duration of lockdowns. It's why the WH keeps asking ""where's Nancy Pelosi"". But when she does pop up elsewhere, she's well-coiffed. This CAN'T be the first time she's done this. Just the first time she's gotten caught. And this stylist renting the chair has probably been the one doing it the whole time. Pelosi herself has said she's been to this salon many times. She just thought they would continue to break the rules for her without any influx of cash from other less privileged customers coming in and would continue to keep their mouths shut. Surprise, people need their businesses to thrive in order to eat."

Neutral,@EverythingConnects,"PM Jacinda Arden is the darling of the corrupt US corporate media, and late night entertainment BUT, this is what happens when a Progressive Socialist (neo-Marxist) is in charge of a (small) country‚Äôs economy.

Her extreme Covid lockdown continues to push New Zealand into its worst, deepest recession since 1987. #parlerusa #parleruk #parlernz #election2020"

Positive,@Brb0702,"Forgive me, but I just have to rant. I'm so angry and disgusted. So let me get this straight, Kamala LaLa can threaten the USA, ON PUBLIC TV, saying that her and her other treasonous ""power hungry whores"" along with their illiterate punks arent stopping now or after the election, they will never stop. That we the people should take note of that and be warned. BUT SHES NOT BEING ARRESTED FOR THREATENING THE USA AND HER PEOPLE AND BEING CHARGED WITH TEASON? WHY NOT?  She is a ""possible"" elected VP or President! Someone better be doing something to this woman and her cronies.  Nancy Pelosi.....she doesnt havent to wear a mask while out, but sure tries to play THE GOOD WITCH on tv and she can even have a hair salon open just for her, like Beetle Juice did?  I'm so tired of this crap! These state officials, so blatantly and in our faces, with what they are allowing to be done and involved in themselves, but yet, face no consequences. God Bless Patriots üôèüôè"

Negative,@GallantlyStreaming,"Please share the heck out of this!!! A friend who works in a local hospital alerted me to the fact that the CDC updated their website and indicated that only 6% of Covid deaths had only Covid. In other words around 10,000.

Neutral,@Javilla1977,"... violent acts around the country by those you claim are peaceful protesters. The same groups, by the way, that don‚Äôt seem to care whether they are following social distancing guidelines. It appears that the virus is so selective that it seems to pass over those that ‚Äúprotest‚Äù but not individuals singing in the church choir. Many appear to be complying with wearing of masks though it isn‚Äôt clear to me whether they are simply following guidelines or are doing so for fear of being identified by authorities as they commit mayhem and destroy public property. In light of recent events, some of you seem to be more offended by labels than to be outraged by the systematic destruction of our cities. In fact, most of the governors and mayors run by Democrats seem to welcome this violence and destruction. Why, every network and Dem official call these ‚Äúpeaceful protesters‚Äù as fires rage in the background, much like Iraqi Bob, as the tanks rolled in the background. Where in the hell were you..."
