Negative,@DeeHicksExplantLiaison,"So let me get this straight. We have an enormous amount of poverty, hunger, child abuse, sex trafficking, murder, vaccine death and injury, missing children and a government and Pharmaceutical industry that becomes richer by the minute and you believe a pandemic with an incredibly low death rate is their top priority? They have destroyed lives, the economy, and are fining people that choose to not wear a mask, arrest business owners that try to make a living, manipulate people, cancel weddings, limit numbers at funerals, exclude visitors from hospitals, cause a mass genocide in nursing homes, cause a race war, intend to mandate vaccines and track people like animals and you think you’re “doing your part” by wearing a mask and social distancing? Unreal.  #qanon #nomasks #echo #trump2020 #kag2020 #deepstateexposed #maga"
