Neutral,@DeplorableC,"ðŸŒŽ IN AN IDEAL WORLD ðŸŒŽ  REPARATIONS, people.  Many Dem Commies howl about reparations, right? Well, I think they've actually talked me into it...with a twist. I think reparations are in order, but NOT from white to black. No. From the Democrat Communist Party to every small business owner in this country. SPREAD THEIR WEALTH  The day after Donald Trump is sworn in for his second term, prosecution of the Democrat Communist Party and their accomplices should begin.  The assets of every sleazebag who participated in the attempted theft of this election using the scandemic as the pathway should have ALL assets seized and divided equally among every small business owner forced to close because of scandemic lies and lockdowns...INCLUDING Anthony Fauci, Pfizer, Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Microsoft, every academic institution that accepted funds from China, and every business funded in any measure with CCP money.  But where would we start? With JOSEPH R. BIDEN, of course."
