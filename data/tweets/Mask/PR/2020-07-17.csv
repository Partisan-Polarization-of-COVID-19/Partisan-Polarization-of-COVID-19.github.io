Neutral,@DeepStuff,"The power of the mainstream media has grown out of control, and this cannot be allowed to continue. Their reach is enormous and instant. With their ability feign outrage and tragedy where none should exists, is very dangerous. Just look at what is happening now with the Black Lives Matter movement, defund the police and even the COVID-19 shutdowns. They literally have politicians, celebrities, pro sports teams and businesses all cowering at their feet. This cannot fall into the realm of freedom of the press or free speech. They are now working in conjunction with policy makers to fix outcomes. We are now facing an existential crisis which should be obvious to all, but it isn‚Äôt and we have no way to communicate it to the masses. Thank God for #Parler, but is it enough? Please, let‚Äôs get the conversation started and keep it going! #Donaldtrump #foxnews #Seanhannity #tuckercarlson #oan #infowars #twexit #backtheblue #defendpolice #police #patriots #wakeup"
Positive,@Djc351,"Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear just made an executive order mandating that every Kentuckian must wear a mask when in public, beginning Friday at 5:00 P.M. The mandate requires ""all customers in retail facilities, grocery stores, anywhere indoors where people cannot stay six feet apart from each other, must wear a mask. The same guidelines adhere to outdoor locations as well if people cannot stay six feet apart. If customers in these businesses refuse to wear a mask, businesses can refuse to serve them. Gov. Beshear says the executive order will continue for 30 days and will be re-evaluated after that."" So to those of you going to the beach or lake or any other type of outdoor recreational activities - masks are a requirement for those places as well. Better get a water proof mask. :p LOL. #covid19 #kentucky #governorandybeshear #GovernorBeshear #maskmandate"
Negative,@GAWWWG1WGA,AZ Governor Doug Ducey at a Brophy HS graduation ceremony with NO MASK. ‚ÄúRules for thee but not for me‚Äù #maskupaz #dougducey #arizona #phoenix
Negative,@carpedonktum,"Went to the post office today, and some guy was freaking out that half of us weren't wearing masks. No I didn't record it, I don't make fun of the mentally disabled(that aren't running for President of the Senate)  Fun fact: Once he left, everyone, masked and unmasked said, asshole, almost in unison. Normal people are done with this crap"
Neutral,@AntonioSabatoJr,It‚Äôs my choice to wear or not wear this silly mask and only my choice.
Neutral,@AntonioSabatoJr,Wearing this mask is freaking stupid just like the law makers who are implementing and forcing it down our throats. I am done with BS!
