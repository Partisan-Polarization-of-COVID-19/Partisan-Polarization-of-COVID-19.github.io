Neutral,@Houstonjimmy42,"Do to the rise in people having sex by staying home from Covid 19/the CDC sees a rise in STD's/a order for mandatory testing is on/ If you know someone who had sex, contact them as contact tracing is available/ let them know the time and place and person/In addition let them know the position and how you did it/it is a Medical emergency/ If you are not sure how to protect yourself during sex/ ask your local politician or government official that mandates the mask/ they will be happy to assist and watch/ For the Good of the Republic report someone who violates these guidelines!!!!"
