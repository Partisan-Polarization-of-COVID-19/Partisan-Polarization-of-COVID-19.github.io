Negative,@anne21,Lord Sumption's talk from last night in which he excoriates the UK government's seizure of power. He starts at 10 mins in #endthelockdown  #PoliceStateUK
Neutral,@191powm,"The U.S. economy grew at the fastest pace ever recorded in the third quarter, expanding at an annualized pace of 33.1 percent, the U.S. Commerce Department said Thursday. The economic rebound means the U.S. recovered significant ground following the record-breaking collapse of output due to lockdowns intended to stem the spread of the coronavirus. Despite the third-quarter gains, the economy is still 3.5 percent smaller than it was as the year began."
Positive,@DewsNewz,"PCR is not a test, it was never intended to be a test. These results are all bogus and not meant to detect COVID-19. Enjoy being lied to. Mask up Sheep! Nearly 800,000 US children have been infected with coronavirus"
Positive,@ApocLips,"China Joe will raise taxes, Lockdown America, & be on board with Forced Vaccines, Mask Mandates, Contact Tracing, Big Tech Tyranny, Big Pharma & Wall Street backing him all the while. Many CDC FDA Employees are Board Members of Big Pharma companies!  Remember when Obama Biden stole $750 Billion from Medicare to Fund Obamacare! They burgled Elderly People who worked their whole lives, paying into Medicare to have it stolen by Democrat Criminals causing Medicare to cover less, Drug Prices to go up, Part B to go up, Deductibles to go up, causing harm to elderly & putting elderly into early graves!!"
Neutral,@donneal,"To Mask, or Not to Mask The sheep who trust their Shepherd don‚Äôt wear masks,  Nor opt to live a life beset by fear; They go about their ordinary tasks,  And understand they have the Shepherd‚Äôs ear. dpn"

Neutral,@fogcitymidge,What‚Äôs really going on with the mask obsession? Check out my new video before it gets removed! üòÆ
Neutral,@Heimdahl1970,"Now put your mask back on, pay your taxes, fight our wars and shut the fuck up little man"
Neutral,@JayinWashington,"What‚Äôs the radical Left going to do when they find out that plexiglass, N95 masks, face shields & surgical gowns are made from oil?"
Neutral,@DavidARidenour,"Next time #JoeBiden says we need a #POTUS who leads by example in wearing a mask, remember this photo of him talking to reporters after the last debate. What‚Äôs wrong with this picture?"
Neutral,@Bobshaw8,"Smug washed out Jennifer Rubin will be begging for Trump when ""hero"" Obama& Biden bring a million Islamist terrorists into neighborhoods near you! The smile Jennifer wears when Obama ""mocks"" Trump will be replaced by mask of sheer terror."
Neutral,@CaptainPugwash,"Yes, the government are throwing money round like confetti, no mention of anything extra for pensioners who have increased gas and electricity bills, or increased shopping bills with online price rises and delivers costs. The cost of fresh masks and sanitizer etc etc , yet they give all to illegal immigrants,,,, The government will be judged at election time."
Neutral,@JohannaByron,"This Friday is my son‚Äôs Senior Districts for Cross Country! In 6 years, I‚Äôve never missed a meet. There were meets where he was on the Injured List that were over 2 hours away, and I didn‚Äôt miss the meet. This Friday is Districts, and guess who won‚Äôt be there to cheer him on for his last race... me, and not only me, but anyone! No Spectators allowed!! I‚Äôm heart broken! I‚Äôve followed every rule this year! Wear your mask, don‚Äôt approach the athletes, social distance! Thanks for nothing, Governor Wolf! #impeachwolf #governorwolfisatyrantscumbag #tomwolfsucks #heartbrokenmom #riseupandrun"
Neutral,@GringoViejo,"I almost missed this one: D. Horowitz‚Äôs interview with Colleen Huber last Friday on Conservative Review (ep.  744). A MUST LISTEN (tho interview only starts about 10 minutes in). Interesting footnote: Huber treats cancer with homeopathic medicine‚Äîas does Carlos Bautista, who cured me this summer when the American medical mainstream left me to die. Search Huber online, and you notice at once that she‚Äôs been saturation-bombed with ‚Äúquack, quack, quack‚Äù because of her regard for natural remedies. Don‚Äôt overlook the lesson here. Leftists will sound like hard-right establishmentarians in order to slur (‚Äúdiscredit‚Äù, they say) someone who challenges their cultic new-orthodoxy: masks, in this case. They have NO logical consistency or bedrock principles."
