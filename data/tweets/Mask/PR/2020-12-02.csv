Positive,@fordg,how many #patriots bitching about #covid #lockdowns and #masks but you are using as #excuse to #workfromhome ? #hypocrites need to get back to work.
Neutral,@Chickapea60,"Democrat Lockdowns Exempt Hollywood, Destroy Small Businesses | Frontpagemag"
Neutral,@Catspaw,All great questions. I think it will require individual business owners to defy the lockdowns & open anyway. They can’t arrest everyone.
Neutral,@Directorate,"#Trump declaring Martial Law would likely be less restrictive than Dem covid ""lockdowns"" which are China's biowarfare & economic attack on the world, but mainly upon the USA - the only nation with DONALD TRUMP to stand between them and their global conquest! #STOPTHESTEAL #RELEASETHEKRAKEN #MARTIALLAW #KAG #MAGA #DIRECTORATE #CHINA #ECHO #PARLER"
Neutral,@created2worship,"As a previous banker and now Accountant, I would advise everyone to remove your money. The communist left are after us and if they are not successful with keeping us silent they will hit us financially. They already hurt us financially with the shutdowns, next will be account freezing. You all already know who owns most of our banking corporations 👉Soros! This is just my suggestion but each individual needs to make that choice for themselves. I myself am only going to keep just enough in there that covers my bills and the rest is coming out!"
Positive,@Elrushbo05,It's time we all stood up and said no more . It starts with the mask mandates and goes from there.If we give them an inch they will try and steal a mile.
Positive,@Bhammer2,Can ANYONE provide Clinical trials... tests...peer reviewed that masks work? I would like to see that.
Negative,@HenHouse0204,California Mayor Reportedly Declares Not Wearing a Mask in Public an 'Act of Domestic Terrorism' But actual domestic terrorists BLM/Antifa are allowed to go maskless and are praised for it 😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡😡
Negative,@FrankCyrill,"This is the Biggest FRAUD in US HISTORY. TIME TO ""Unmask"" the perpeTRAITORS..!! THIS IS Treason against our country. DEEP STATE, BIG TECH, LAME STREAM MEDIA, we are coming for all of you. #Q #WHITEHATWARRIORS #HOUSEOFCARDS #MAGA"
Neutral,@Elrushbo05,"Screw the mask crap already, they don't work."
Neutral,@ExtraMile,"Here Liberals- chew on this, or should I say- chew on your virtual-signaling mask/muzzles"

Neutral,@JessicaFox86,"These people are rich with 💩. Not wearing a mask, that doesn’t work, is domestic terrorism, but Antifa is..... made up?!  These people are nuts. Resist the bullshit!!!!!!!"
Neutral,@AngryAsian,"It might not be fashionable, but all these police ""just following orders"" need to be named and shamed! If you break up a large group of people or arrest someone for not wearing a mask, YOU are breaking your oath to the constitution of the USA #politics #memes #DefundthePolice #COVID"
Neutral,@Floridacracker2,"I'm guessing I am in the minority on this thread. However, I plan on getting the vaccine as soon as it is available. I get annual flu shots, have taken the pneumonia vaccine, Hepatitus A & B vaccines, and the list goes on. I don't understand why people would not take them, but that is their choice. I do it to protect against transmission from people just like I witnessed in a chain office supply business yesterday. 70ish guy without mask ahead of me licked his fingers several times to sort thru papers which he in turn handed the clerk and she then sorted thru them almost guaranteeing to catch anything he may be carrying. I personally want to be protected from idiots up and down the infection chain."
