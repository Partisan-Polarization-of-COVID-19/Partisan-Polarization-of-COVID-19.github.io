Neutral,@JonathanWilberger,"A young child wearing a face mask is a very disturbing thing to see. Since kids show little to no symptoms of covid and there's been virtually no child covid deaths, I think it's safe to say that forcing kids under the age of 13 to wear masks is child abuse. Who agrees?"

Neutral,@CommunistsDeserveToDie,Itâ€™s just a mask. Itâ€™s just six feet. Itâ€™s just two weeks. Itâ€™s just non-essential businesses. Itâ€™s just non-essential workers. Itâ€™s just a bar. Itâ€™s just a restaurant. Itâ€™s just to keep from overwhelming the hospitals. Itâ€™s just until the cases go down. Itâ€™s just to flatten the curve. Itâ€™s just a few inmates. Itâ€™s just for a few more weeks. Itâ€™s just church. You could still pray. Itâ€™s just prayer. Itâ€™s just singing in church. Itâ€™s just until we get a vaccine. Itâ€™s just an app. Itâ€™s just for tracing. Itâ€™s just to let people know youâ€™re safe to be around. Itâ€™s just to let others know who youâ€™ve been in contact with. Itâ€™s just a few more months. Itâ€™s just a video. Itâ€™s just a post. Itâ€™s just an email account. Itâ€™s just a Twitter/YouTube/Facebook account. Itâ€™s just for protecting others from hate speech. Itâ€™s just for protecting others from hurt feelings. Itâ€™s just a large gathering but for protests. Itâ€™s just some statues. It's just your freedoms....gone forever.
