Positive,@Funkytown03,"Governor Newsom considering ""Stay at home order."" Start by telling illegals who are well enough to drive or walk, to return to Mexico. Arrogant narcissistic prick. But it won't keep him and Pelosi at home. #TN2 #co4djt #gijoevets"

Neutral,@GeorgeWu,"Patriots and freedom-loving people the world over are fed up w/ lockdowns, shut downs, muzzling assemblies/free speech."
Neutral,@flintbedrock,"BUFFALO NY: Business Owners Stand Up, Fight back and Kick out Sheriff & Health Dept !üôå Chant ‚ÄúWE WILL NOT COMPLY‚Äù  ‚ûñIf every biz owner would do this lockdowns would be over"
Neutral,@dreverettpiper,"If you are advocating for lockdowns, you are complicit in tearing families apart. You are complicit in inflicting untold suffering on millions of people around the world. You are complicit in casting the poorest and most vulnerable in our societies into even further grinding poverty. You are complicit in murder. A line is being crossed right now. Which side of history are you on? Make your decision now and make it wisely, because your actions during these times will not be forgotten."
Neutral,@Dtcussen,"I don‚Äôt know what your game is, just do it, why wait 10-14 days, just like Covid lockdown will be over in 14 days üôÑ"
Neutral,@carpedonktum,"Well, we had a good run everybody, it was a great republic while it lasted.

Negative,@COLconservative,"I drove from CO to OK to have Thanksgiving with family. On my way home I joked with a guy at the gas station that it felt like I was returning to prison; I was only half kidding. For months my sister had been telling me how normal things were in OK. I believed her but it was quite eye opening to experience it myself. These contrasting pics of CO vs OK gyms tell the story better than my words could: CO gym (only open because counties fought back after Polis moved them to red) -extremely limited capacity of 10 per room (hence the tarps - credit given for creatively exploiting a loophole) -masks required even while doing cardio solo on socially distanced equipment  -no locker room, drinking fountain use -must make an appointment OK gym (open fully, in addition to restaurants & other businesses) -no masks or capacity limits  -distancing encouraged but people don‚Äôt freak about it  -you can get a drink, hit the shower & actually breathe while exerting yourself -go when you feel like it"

Negative,@civicsjunky,Unmask!!
Neutral,@JonathanWilberger,"Last night, I went into Wal-Mart to grab paper plates and a bottle of wine. I use a gator so I can wear it around my neck. It makes people less likely to try and start crap with me if they see that I at least have a mask in my possession. But I don't pull it up around my face. So as I was going through the entrance, the associate asks me ""do you have a mask?"" I said ""yep I got one right here"" and pointed to the gator around my neck. She said ""oh ok"" and I walked through without hassle. As I left she wished me a good night. We do not have to be rebellious in order to acquire fresh air at the store. People are so wired and brainwashed into thinking that masks are our salvation that they actually calm down if they see you have one in your possession. You don't have to pull it up to your face."
Neutral,@DIPYO,The dangers of fake masks
Neutral,@Coni71,They automatically have gas mask? Hummmm

Neutral,@ChelseyATX,"Truth, but everyone should wear a fucking mask around others -don‚Äôt be selfish."
Neutral,@Goldygirl,"In approximately 10 months the republican ‚Äúleaders‚Äù shut down our schools, forced our businesses to close (but not Amazon, Walmart, Home Depot or any ‚Äúessential‚Äù big box store), kept families apart, allowed ANTIFA and BLM to burn out cities, forces us to cover our faces with masks, used fraud to seize power AND THEY HAVE THE AUDACITY TO ACUSE THE RIGHT OF TRYING TO STAGE A COUP?!?!?!"
