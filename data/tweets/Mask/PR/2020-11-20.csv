Call your local politicians (State and Federal).  Tell them you want transparency.  Tel them you want the lockdowns to end.  Tell State lawmakers to take back Cuomos unchecked power over the lives of millions of us as he continues to completely collapse our economy and cast us into oblivion.  The time is now.  Not tomorrow.  Not after Trump wins his court cases.  Not after Christmas.  Now.

Positive,@DominicDeBona,"Man fucking government paying me to stay home? Sounds like a dream. No, not a dream. A nightmare. They’re paying you to stay home(probably with the taxes you already give to the government. Too). I don’t really have many words to be honest. It’s disgusting behaviour. And ahistorical, throughout governments take from you not give. Why are you paying us to stay home and who’s fucking money are you giving us. AOC, let’s be honest. You are probably one of the stupidest people on the planet.(probably think sticking your hand in the microwave is a good way to warm your body.) Your socialist shit won’t work here. And it won’t work on me. You can’t fuck your way out of this one. I wonder who’s dick you sucked to become a congresswoman anyways. Because you definitely didn’t get it because of your intelligence or character. Wow bit of a rant. Paying millions of people to stay home. Sounds good on paper, but basic economics means it won’t work. Not for long anyways."

It is amazing but that is completely looked down upon now...if the woman isn’t chasing money all day, she’s a waste. I have a part time job but FAMILY IS 100 percent more important!!!!!!

Neutral,@DawgFerale,"All of these democrat mayors, governors, etc., reinstating lockdowns, banning Thanksgiving, limiting indoor gatherings to 10 or less and perpetuating this lie are blithering idiots who are not interested one iota in your safety. They could care less whether you live or die, they just want to control you. I’ve said this from day one of this virus thing, the lockdowns have never been about protecting your health, they’ve all been about control."
Neutral,@GeoffMcKenzie,"Follow me here... 1) Covid has never been a pandemic. It has always been about control! 2) Masks and lockdowns have never been about your health. They have always been about teaching you to submit to unreasonable demands. 3) Covid, masks, lockdowns, and censorship were designed to break our spirit so we would let them steal the election and would do nothing to stop them. They made one Yuge mistake: they underestimated the resiliency of the American spirit! I think this ""pandemic"" was planned for a Clinton presidency, and might have worked. But the globalists didn't see Trump coming and how he would invigorate the populist love of America. Rise up! Speak out! Americans do not kneel! We fight! No justice! No peace!"

One against the world’s mightiest military to secure our freedom and right to govern ourselves and another war for the freedom of those in bondage that couldn’t fight for themselves. Freedom and an independent soul is hard coded to our DNA. Comparing the USA to countries that are steeped in serfdom is not a valid comparison.

Neutral,@Gvanavery,"Masks. Yet to see anyone on the “News” say more than they work, but if ANY of them had journalistic integrity they would explain how.  The 3-layer cloth masks will block about 0 to 10% of infectious particles. Surgical types will block about 40%, and N-95’s, 95%.  If it takes about 1000 infectious particles during 10-15 mins to catch Covid, and breathing can shed 40 particles per min, and talking 3000 per min then a cloth mask is useless. 3000 – 10% (the talking persons mask) = 2700. Minus another 10% (your mask) is 2430. So if you wear a cloth mask in a tight space with a talking infected person, you will likely catch it in the first minute. Surgical mask. 3000 – 40% = 1800 – 40% = 1080. Again, you caught it. N-95. 3000 -95% = 150 – 95% = 7.5 particles. You can talk for about 1.5 hrs if both of you are wearing masks. If someone has it and coughs, that’s about 40,000 infectious particles. Do the math. #parler #newuser #america #patriots #stopcensorship #freespeech #christian"

Neutral,@fenolj,"It is my understanding that the release of this study was delayed for fear of the reaction to it.  This credible study from Norway finds that masks do not work against Covid-19.  Individuals who believe in masks should wear them. However, when a government entity mandates the wearing of masks, it becomes an assault on individual liberty & the right of free men & women to choose for themselves.  It is unacceptable & should be unconstitutional for government to mandate masks in violation of individual liberty￼.  Ronald Reagan warned us, when government expands, liberty contracts.

So we’ve gone from “2 weeks to flatten the curve” to a “year or two for a vaccine” to “forever until there’s no chance of anyone dying at all because science has granted us immortality by eliminating all risks in life, including the risk of fun.” This, of course, means we’re once again confronted with the reality that our “experts” are idiots."

Neutral,@Damonty362,The Atlantic has reached a new low and that bar was set very low already. They just wrote an article hailing Denmark’s low birth rate of Down’s Syndrome babies. Only 18 born in 2019. It’s because the country is using eugenics to eliminate these babies by abortion. It’s offensive on many levels including I have a cousin who has Down’s. The satanic mask is completely off. This is the magazine that brought us the story about Trump calling military “suckers” and losers and pushed the idea that Iraq had WMD which started the war. Both of those articles based on the infamous anonymous sources. I’m only posting this because people should be aware of what the left is cheering and celebrating.
Neutral,@Garyalphoto,"Think about the numbers involved in that. COVID is still 99.4% survivable, and truly only represents an out-sized danger to those above 75 years of age. Under that age range, you are talking about death rates that either mirror the flu or are less than the flu as you get into children. While a flu vaccine is typically only 40% effective, new vaccines for COVID have shown effectiveness rates of 95%. That means that once the vaccine is deployed, COVID will be far less of a problem than the regular flu. Yet, Fauci still wants you to wear ineffective masks and socially distance for years afterward. For what? Is the goal for no one to ever die again or to manage the disease in a responsible manner?"

This after shutting down for two months in the spring, almost everyone is wearing masks, restaurants are keeping groups separated, large gatherings like concerts and sporting events have been closed for most of the year, more people are working from home than ever before, cruises aren’t sailing and relatively few people are taking vacations. We’ve done everything the “experts” have asked yet coronavirus continues to spread. Following the “experts” advice hasn’t stopped the virus, but the government response has destroyed lives, livelihoods, the economy, and increased government power and reduced us as individuals.

Neutral,@Drjohnballard,"Your Monday COVID-19 update: With colder weather and more people spending time indoors, the US has seen a 71.4% increase in our per capita death rate since mid October, from 2.1 to 3.6 per million. This is still substantially better than what is going on in Italy, Spain, France, and the UK, whose rates, as you can see below, are spiking dramatically. The provisional death rate bears out this surge showing the first real increase since the secondary peak in august.  I’ve said it many times, and will say it again here: this is a serious disease that no one wants to get. I’ve been berated and mocked mercilessly for pointing out that it still has well over 99% survival rate. Making that point does not diminish the losses we’ve experienced; it is simply a fact.
