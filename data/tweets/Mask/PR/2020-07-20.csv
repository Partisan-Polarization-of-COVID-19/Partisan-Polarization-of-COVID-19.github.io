Positive,@Ehassevoort,Why were peaceful protests against stay home stay safe orders deemed unsafe by democrat leaders but the riots and “peaceful” protests we’ve seen since the end of May have been deemed safe by democrat leaders? We were told these events wouldn’t cause the COVID19 spikes we have been seeing the past couple weeks. Why aren’t they being held accountable? Because Democrats only care about one thing. Getting President Trump out of office and could care less if they destroy the USA in the process. MAGA2020 TRUMP2020🇺🇸🇺🇸
Neutral,@BlairCountyYoungRepublicans,"GREAT E-board meeting tonight. Lots of productive, intelligent discussion about voter contact strategies. If we go into another quarantine/lockdown, we are PREPARED and have a backup plan if the virus gridlocks society again. Thanks to those who attended the meeting tonight! #LeadRight"
Neutral,@DewsNewz,"Why we don’t trust anything coming from the mouths of Fauci, CDC or the NIH criminals..... They have yet to tell their citizens that zinc when used with quercetin (opens the cells up like hydroxychloroquine) is a great cheap preventative and will lesson symptoms of COVID-19 and using Budesonide and other anti inflammatories when diagnosed will ensure rapid recovery most of the time. Instead they mandate mask use, lock downs, expensive high end drugs, ventilators while putting COVID patients into nursing homes, and promoting useless vaccines (which we’ve already paid for). They act this stupid and reckless and the MSM blames it on Trump.  What do you think they will do to you if he loses?  Trump 2020 4 More Years of Leftist butthurt!"
Positive,@HubLife,The Constitution does NOT give the Federal or State government the right to force me to wear a mask. Full stop. Fuck these commie pricks.
Negative,@Healthyrvguy,"No mask, even medical, is 100% effective against COVID-19. If you look on the boxes of loop masks like the one pictured, the manufacturer will even have a disclaimer that it does not protect against COVID-19 (coronavirus) or any other virus or airborne disease. So, if you are counting on a mask to save you from getting the virus, forget it. Eventually, you probably will get the virus as much as you are active in social settings. Better to keep your immune system ready for the upcoming fight or never to come into contact with another human being during the crisis."
Negative,@carpedonktum,"Went to the post office today, and some guy was freaking out that half of us weren't wearing masks. No I didn't record it, I don't make fun of the mentally disabled(that aren't running for President of the Senate)  Fun fact: Once he left, everyone, masked and unmasked said, asshole, almost in unison. Normal people are done with this crap"
Neutral,@endosispatriot,"During the 1918 influenza pandemic in San Francisco, California, a group of citizens that included doctors and several city supervisors formed an ""Anti-Mask League"" after becoming frustrated with mandated mask-wearing.New York State's anti-mask law was enacted in 1845, to provide for public safety after disputes between landlords and tenants. Many anti-mask laws date back to the mid-20th century, when states and municipalities passed them to stop the violent activities of the Ku Klux Klan, whose members typically wore hoods of white linen to conceal their identities."
Neutral,@Ehassevoort,Good facts on masks
Neutral,@haypal,Now this is government overreach if I've ever seen it. Masks should be a CHOICE.
Neutral,@BlenderMN,Might fuck around and go outside without a mask
Neutral,@ConservativeNYMom,It’s Just a Mask ... #masksdontwork It’s just a vaccine!
Neutral,@angelamoore,"Yes, children should go back to school in the fall.  And no, they should not be required to wear masks."
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,The masks don’t work. You’re just suffocating yourselves & giving in to tyranny. Take them off.
Neutral,@HubLife,I'm not wearing a mask and this is absolutely a hill I am willing to die on against the state and local governments. Fuck these corrupt authoritarian assholes.

Neutral,@gadsdengirl,Could this be more racist? People of color are exempt from wearing masks. Why? Does Portland want them to get sick and die? Do they want to be able to identify black criminals? YES!!

Neutral,@ConservativeNYMom,"Btw, I did look at the numbers from this meme and compared to make sure numbers were not bullsh*t... they actually all went up! Pakistan: 262,000 Iran: 269,000 Turkey: 218,000  Saudi Arabia: 248,000 India: 1.04M So Cuomo screw your mask mandate!"
Neutral,@Bronx66,"Well it's official.. It's been 2 weeks since my wife and I went to beautiful Panama City Beach FL and stayed in a condo right on the gulf. A full week of beach, restaurants, bars, a few excursions, shopping etc.. Hardly saw a mask anywhere...(Didn't bring ours) and well.. We are just fine. Hmmm 🤔 #SombodyLied"
Neutral,@Bronx66,"This Saturday, 4th of July, I will be having about 30 family members to my house. We will cook out, drink some beers, play with the children, share stories, laugh and enjoy our family. We will NOT be serving Kool-Aid or wearing masks. I wish you all a happy and safe 4th of July. Happy Birthday USA! 🎉 🎆 🎊 🎇"
