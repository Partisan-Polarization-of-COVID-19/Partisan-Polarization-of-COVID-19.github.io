Positive,@Alrightman,"SEC going to fine coaches based on video evidence of how much they're on camera without a mask.  ______We started on Monday using broadcast game footage evaluating every time a head coach is on camera is the mask up?"" Sankey said. ""Yes or no? And if it's no, are they social distanced? Maybe it's the best way to track participation. ______They are our leaders, our most visible leaders within our athletics programs. My message is they have a responsibility to lead. Wearing those masks during our games is a leadership responsibility."" No, it's to be a compliant role model. This is out of control. #firefauci #masksdontwork #nextstophijabsandburkas"
