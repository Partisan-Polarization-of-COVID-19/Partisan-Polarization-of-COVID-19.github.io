Negative,@FreeEarthlings,"Dr. #ReinerFuellmich on #PCRtestScandal  The #Covid19Crisis must be renamed a #CoronaScandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages. How dangerous is the virus? What is the significance of a positive #PCRtest? What is the collateral damage with respect to #health and #economy? An international network of lawyers will argue the biggest #TortCase ever - the #CoronaFraudScandal - which has unfolded into probably the greatest #CrimesAgainstHumanity ever committed. #Scientists and #lawyers recognise that as a result of the deliberate panic-mongering and the corona measures enabled by this panic, #democracy is in great danger of being replaced by #FascistTotalitarian models. To make sure that no one will ever again be in a position of such power as to be able to defraud humanity, or to attempt to manipulate us with their corrupt agendas. #SaveTheEconomy #DefendHumanity #EndLockdowns  #MakeLawLawfulAgain  #GetOffOurRights"
Positive,@Allenford1927,"Am i the only one who drives around and sees people everywhere wearing masks/faceshields even if their walking by themselves and feel like you're in an apocoliptic movie from the 80's? Like ""Maximum Overdrive"" or something? I just can't get used to this mask thing! Wear a mask if you feel like it's going help, but it is such a crazy deal to see it everywhere you go! It's a real life version of the movie ""Outbreak"" I'm waiting for Dustin Hoffman to come out of the woodwork wearing a hazmat suit somewhere in this! ðŸ˜†"
Neutral,@gregyost7777,"Walmart allows BLM masks to be worn by employees, but they are not allowed to wear Trump masks."
Neutral,@FreeWillExpress,Doctors speak out against masks - YouTube
Neutral,@curtisfisher,The governor in Pennsylvaniaactually said you should wear masks in your home...hahahah.. ummm Ithought Gavin Newsome was a moron..well he is...but wow
Neutral,@Jayanne82,"I was just curious what the meaning of ""looking Presidential""eluded to. Is it walking on stage at the beginning of the last debate making the grand gesture of pulling off his mask when it could have been done BEFORE he entered or is it the demeaner of trust and confidence of a President who has not only made promises but also kept them. I would rather have a man like that even if his attire was bib overalls and dusty boots. I don't vote for ""looking Presidential""! I vote for a President I can trust. TRUMP!  ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡· ðŸ˜˜ ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡±ðŸ‡· ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸"
