Positive,@FaithFamilyFitness,"It’s simple to me. If you’re afraid to teach in the classroom, then stay at home. Plenty of qualified teachers willing to do the job. Substitute and student teachers are better than kids trying to figure it out on their own at home. Not to mention all the intangibles: Socialization, counseling services, meals at school, etc."
Neutral,@Angiez00r,So last Friday I was having Shortness of breath and other symptoms. I immediately quarantined myself from my family. Took a COVID-19 test Saturday and tomorrow the quarantine period is over and still no test results. I asked for a steroid inhaler and that wouldn't have been given to me if I hadn't asked. What a poor system. If they would allow Hydroxychloroquine we wouldn't be in the current situation of high cases. I believe the front line doctors. I go back to work Monday without test results since the labs are overwhelmed.
Neutral,@FaithFamilyFitness,"We have a primary coming up in Michigan tomorrow. After months of lockdowns, business closings and mandatory face masks for all indoor gatherings, the governor has declared that face masks aren’t required to vote. Where is the logic in that, or in any of her other decisions for that matter?"
Positive,@DavidWDunn,"Fauci is now recommending goggles. Will the mask Nazis wear goggles? If not, then they are picking and choosing what they are willing to submit to, same as those who choose not to wear a mask.  I’ll go out on a limb and say they don’t wear goggles, but continue to berate those who don’t wear masks. Hypocrisy follows the liberal like a shadow."
Positive,@AppleJax,"Ian Smith NJ Gym owners  Statement was so good I wrote it down... I’m not afraid of Tyrants, and no American should be, because we outnumber them greatly, and the only thing they run on is Fear,  and you see in there Media they pump Fear into the Corona Virus.  When what they should be pumping is solutions.   They don’t do that, they never offer any solutions.  Instead it’s Wear a Mask 😷  Shut-up, and wait for a Vaccine 💉  That’s not Public Health And I won’t Subscribe to it! -Ian Smith"
Neutral,@Aaron112195,"I visited two large beaches over the weekend. If you can tell Trump supporters by who wears the mask and who doesn’t, Trump wins in a landslide. I was at the beach with thousands and 99% did not have on a mask and really did not “social distance”. Then there were the few who looked like complete idiots wearing a mask at the beach outdoors in 90’ temps. You could just tell they were dumb ass Democrats!"

Neutral,@DewsNewz,Wear your mask!
Neutral,@AIRFORCEVET,I think we ALL should wear masks...
Neutral,@floridaborn,The mask police got David Harris. No more American Airlines.
Neutral,@HubLife,Wearing a mask doesn't save lives. Voting Democrats out of office at all levels of government saves lives.
Neutral,@ISupportBlueLives,Where's Their Masks???? Biden is such a dumbass. He said Tallahassee instead of Jacksonville where the GOP convention was to take place. Thank you President Trump!!!! MAGA 2020
Neutral,@Johnadodson,"In Chicago this year, 417 people have been murdered, 238 have died of Covid-19. Thats a difference of 117. Defunding the Police and forcing people to wear masks? More liberal logic. #parler"
Neutral,@Ameliab97,"YES!!!!!!!! Thank God!!!! Say NO to masks!!!! They do nothing except lower your oxygen intake. If you want to know what equipment you actually need to keep a virus like out, ask a virologist. 🙌🏻 #saynotomasks #itsnotaboutourhealth"
Neutral,@FaithFamilyFitness,One question: Who the hell is Joe Biden to be telling governors to enforce a three month outdoor mask mandate? What gives him that authority? There is no sound scientific evidence to back that up. Joe you have a bad combination of arrogance and dementia.
Neutral,@Clinton614,"USA USA USA 🇺🇸🇺🇸 The amount of support we had was overwhelming. First time I've felt normal in months. Nobody had on a mask, just about everyone was armed, hundreds of cars driving by honking, waving and showing their support.... This is how you counter a BLM protest and shut them down! #clinton614"
Neutral,@Jglovac,"BY THE WAY, Thise ARE NOT moms & Vets making lines at the riors! LOOK CLOSE AT THEM! THEY ARE NOT OLD ENOUGH TO BE MOMS & VETS! They make up a tee shirt that says USMC Vet! That DOES NOT MAKE THEM ONE! I SEE THRU THEIR SCAM! They wear ful, masks so you can't see their faces & make up shirts! REAL VETS WOULD WEAR A REAL SHIRT! Nice try punks!"
Neutral,@Gbennett01,"I find it ironic that the STL Cardinals series in Detroit was canceled because 13 players and staff tested positive for COVID-19. They returned to St. Louis and were retested and they were all negative!￼ Ok, let’s play ball. End of story... ￼This actually tells the story of all the increased cases of COVID-19 right. They’re mostly false positives! ￼Yet you hear nothing about it from the lame stream￼ media and shithead Dr Fauci. Are you congressmen and women and senators in Washington￼can go screw yourselves with your Covid bullshit￼! Shove your masks up your ass!￼"
