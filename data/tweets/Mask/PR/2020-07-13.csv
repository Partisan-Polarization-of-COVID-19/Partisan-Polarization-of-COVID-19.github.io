Positive,@JHrusky,"What do these idiots expect the world to do? Stay home for the next 1, 2, 4 years until a vaccine is not only developed, but tested, ensured safe, and given to billions of people? Is that the plan?  Yes, the virus is here.  Yes, it is going to stay here and not go away.  Yes, more people will get infected.  Yes, more people have already been infected. But people cannot live in a bubble.  People have to leave their homes. People have to buy supplies. People have to work.  And people have to interact."
Positive,@Grizzgrumps,"Imagine you were born in 1900. When you're 14, World War I begins and ends when you're 18 with 22 million dead. Soon after a global pandemic, the Spanish Flu, appears, killing 50 million people. And you're alive and 20 years old. When you're 29 you survive the global economic crisis that started with the collapse of the New York Stock Exchange, causing inflation, unemployment and famine. When you're 33 years old the nazis come to power. When you're 39, World War II begins and ends when you're 45 years old with a 60 million dead. In the Holocaust 6 million Jews die. When you're 52, the Korean War begins. When you're 64, the Vietnam War begins and ends when you're 75. A child born in 1985 thinks his grandparents have no idea how difficult life is, but they have survived several wars and catastrophes. Today we have all the comforts in a new world, amid a new pandemic. But we complain because we need to wear Masks, Get paid to stay Home etc Today a Spoilt Woke Society. WAKE THE FUCK UP üò†"
Neutral,@Amyvennon,"If our governors force us to quarantine again, it won‚Äôt be to protect us from a fake virus. It‚Äôs a power trip and nothing else!"
Neutral,@ChrisAdler,Quarantine is when you restrict the movement of sick people... Tyranny is when you restrict the movement of healthy people! We are Americans and we will not tolerate this! Echo if you agree
Neutral,@aalaeh,"Trump should have said lock down everything and the demos would scream open up the economy. Trump should support BLM, and the demos would denounce it. We should keep schools closed, the demos will want them open. They do the exact opposite of whatever Trump says. My point? They are the reason for the divide. Sorry about stating the obvious."
Positive,@DrGosar,"Who to believe? We live in an era where ideology drives ‚Äúscience‚Äù which is completely unscientific.  We are told, indeed ordered under penalty of jail or fines, to wear a mask outside. Articles appear daily touting the benefits of masks. But what does the science really say? Here‚Äôs this from the New England Journal of Medicine in its May 21, 2020 edition: ‚ÄúWe know that wearing a mask outside health care facilities offers little, if any, protection from infection. Public health authorities define a significant exposure to Covid-19 as face-to-face contact within 6 feet with a patient with symptomatic Covid-19 that is sustained for at least a few minutes (and some say more than 10 minutes or even 30 minutes). The chance of catching Covid-19 from a passing interaction in a public space is minimal. In many cases, the desire for widespread masking is a reflexive reaction to anxiety over the pandemic.‚Äù  The mask can‚Äôt cover media lies."
Positive,@DewsNewz,"We sooo stupid now, we read side of mask box and New England Journal of Medicine article. People who don't wear a mask have lower cognitive ability, says study"
Positive,@Conservativesorrynotsorry,Dont you DARE wear a mask!!!
Positive,@Cobiesson,"Tells CA churches they cannot sing, chant, etc. then tells protesters if the yell,, sing, chant make sure to wear a mask."
Positive,@Deevaughn,"Never would I ever downplay this virus. People have died. People are really sick. But it has not and is not as contagious as the media is making out to be.  Example 1: Dr. gets sick, decides to have a test. It comes back positive. Fever for a few days, that‚Äôs it. No one in the office comes back positive or his household!  Example 2: I do not wear a mask at work. I am in close contact with many people a day. No one in the office has become sick. None of our patients have tested positive.  That‚Äôs how contagious this virus is!"
Positive,@Flirtyskirt,If me not wearing a mask on MY FACE is a problem for YOU please stay 6 feet away. Thanks.
Positive,@ArsonRenllaw,"What happened to Texas? The ""Great State of Texas."" Following the lead of California with mandatory masks."
Negative,@jeepvette77,"If they want to play this game, then patriots must set up so called CHOP zones in small towns, where all businesses remain open and under guard of patriots. No masks, no restrictions, just freedom. What say you?"
Negative,@Deevaughn,Good morning patriots! üá∫üá∏ Happy Monday! Off to work I go where I will be in close contact with over 60 people today! Three months into the deadliest virus know to man and I‚Äôm still alive! Health comes from the inside! #chiropractic #getadjusted #healthyliving #immunesystem #nomask
Negative,@DylanWheeler511,Take your masks OFF!!!! This is a fairly easy experiment to duplicate. Masks appear to lower your environmental oxygen level SIGNIFICANTLY. Which would mean you're starving your brain for oxygen when you wear them. Meaning you‚Äôre slowly killing yourselves.
Negative,@carpedonktum,"Went to the post office today, and some guy was freaking out that half of us weren't wearing masks. No I didn't record it, I don't make fun of the mentally disabled(that aren't running for President of the Senate)  Fun fact: Once he left, everyone, masked and unmasked said, asshole, almost in unison. Normal people are done with this crap"
Neutral,@Daniel04,Alabama is adopting a state wide masks order. Non working masks for all.
Neutral,@ArthurFitzgerald22,"Here‚Äôs the answers to those questions Katie. 1.) Black on Black killings do not happen because of race. A black person, has never killed another black person, for the simple fact that they are black. The white policeman that murdered George Floyd had his home searched, and had applied to join the KKK. This shows that the White man murdering the black man was solely a racially inspired murder. 2.) People want the police who brutalise innocent black people to be charged and prosecuted. Petitions online help, but protests actually show the anger, and help communities understand that racism is not okay, and we can not be silent on the matter. 3.) Many protests were socially distant and the protesters wore masks. Strange how you hate masks and lockdown, but when it‚Äôs the BAME community fighting for their human rights you question it? When people are angry because someone has been murdered for their skin colour, why is your initial reaction to argue with them, not stand with them?"
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a mask....‚Äù
Neutral,@Bestla808,This is Hawaii right now. Everyone is the mask police.
Neutral,@haypal,Now this is government overreach if I've ever seen it. Masks should be a CHOICE.

Neutral,@BarbDelcoPa,"Oh so now the loony toon left own the words 'I can't breathe"". What nonsense. I say that every day as soon as I leave the store and rip off the mask I had to wear in the store because the gestapo gov of Pa made it law."
Neutral,@cjtruth,"Great New  @StormIsUponUs  video. A must see! You're being scammed by enemies of America who occupy powerful positions in government and the media. November 2020 is the way we, the people, can fight back. Know your enemy. Ditch the masks. Rise. #Covid911 youtu.be/-fhGV1LxeKQ"

Neutral,@Charityh81,"This is why it's vitally important that we keep researching and stating data and evidence before hurling opinions. The media, who have zero scientific data, is manipulating and instigating panic and division in this country. Sadly, MOST people, instead of looking at the data on the virus for themselves, are relying on the media and so-called experts on everything from mask-wearing, vaccines, to the TRUE fatality rate of the virus. PLEASE! Do your own research and don't blindly follow the crowd. But more importantly, listen to the Holy Spirit! He will ALWAYS teach and reveal to you the truth and what is best for you."
