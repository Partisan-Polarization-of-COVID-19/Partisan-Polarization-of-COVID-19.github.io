Neutral,@Hlbatista,"In Virginia I just don’t understand why an uptick in positive Covid test, please note, not hospitalizations nor deaths should be laid at the feet of small businesses. It seems that for the last several months grocery stores and big box stores have been going full throttle I have noticed most employees and folks had not been wearing mask. So why is it now that our idiot governor decides to start having the state check small business and restaurants. Is it their fault? Let’s understand the context of the uptick and the ages of those being infected and ask what streets and statues have they recently visited? I have a feeling we may discover the “why” in the uptick."
Neutral,@BJM1776,"It pains me to say it, but today Governor Abbott is coming off like just another Chamber of Commerce Statist. Rolling back the openings in Texas will have devastating impacts on small business owners and local economies. Already I and others are taking money out of Dallas County to places that do not require Masks ( #FaceDiapers ) which can cause the wearer health issues and are of questionable efficacy when dealing with CCPVirus. Now the Governor has crippled many small businesses with the Retreat (capitulation) on re-opening our Great State of Texas. The CCPVirus death rate in Texas is 8 per 100k, a full 4.9 per 100k less than the 2018 Influenza/Pneumonia rate. It is time to be for Texans and not the narrative. We can measure our own risk, make our own choices, and look out for ourselves. Governor Abbott needs to change course, NOW."
