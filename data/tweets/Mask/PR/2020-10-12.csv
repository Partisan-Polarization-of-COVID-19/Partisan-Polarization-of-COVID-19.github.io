Neutral,@DanSmith,I hope the best for President Trump and the First Lady after their positive test for the Corona Virus. He has lived a healthy life so the fact that he has no underlying conditions makes me hopeful that he will make it through this obstacle. President Trump has been burning the candles at both ends so maybe having the ability to take some time off for a quarantine period will recharge his batteries for the final leg of the campaign before the election. Reading the Twitter comments again speaks to how the Democratic Party and their groupthink ilk have devolved from the party of compassion to the party of pettiness and spite. A lot of people really dislike our president without ever having met him. That means the media's coverage of him is their only vestibule to who he is and the followers of the mainstream media will not consider the extreme bias that is used in their reporting.
Positive,@DFoster569,So a friend of the family stopped in today who was a guard at the local jail and he stated that they let so many prisoners out and they're not charging new prisoners with the crimes they're only at now they're up to 60% capability but he said I got to tell you one of our prisoners is the one who refused to put a mask on these other ones that are creating felonies and was let out is now been replaced with a man who refused to wear a mask he stated it was unconstitutional they put him in jail I'm telling you I've never seen the likes of this
