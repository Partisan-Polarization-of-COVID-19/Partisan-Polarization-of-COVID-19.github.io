Negative,@JkayKAG,I had no idea!!! Every American Should Be Made Aware Of This!!! ECHO so that this information is distributed to the Public #faucifraud #greed #openourschools #reopenamerica
Positive,@ConservativeinLBC,"Must be nice to tell everyone to stay home, social distance, and wear masks...but you get to enjoy a game in person, with your do-nothing face mask off! Elite liberal privilege!"
Positive,@AZCowboyConstitutionalist,"This is what we should really fear, not some flu-like virus that has a mortality rate of less than 1%. Vulnerable seniors should stay home if they‚Äôre so inclined. They don‚Äôt gave the right to deny us our rights or to mandate their superstitious mask wearing remedy."
Neutral,@BILLMCMICHEALS,You DO NOT want to miss This weekend's PODCAST from lil' ol me and @Carolinabell .. How can one get a STATE ORDERED Wuhan Virus cvd-19 quarantine WITHOUT a test by proxy? We'll explain and prove you can in a certain Well-Known STATE..
Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,"An apartment complex in Ventura County, CA is locking their residents inside the building until all of them are tested for Covid. I called the number, was put on hold, & then eventually forwarded to voicemail. This is the dangerous slope we‚Äôve been talking about - & it‚Äôs exactly what the Cabal wants. They don‚Äôt even have to mandate laws or draft legislation when landlords, banks, businesses, etc. will go along with the agenda & require this out of their tenants /customers. And what happens if 1 child tests positive in a public school setting? Will they lockdown that entire school until every kid is forcefully tested then shipped to a ‚Äúquarantine facility‚Äù if positive? This is called tyranny & it never ends up well for us citizens. It‚Äôs time to wake up & fight for our God-given rights. #WWG1WGA"
Neutral,@johnnypatriot1,"THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A SECOND IF YOU AREN'T CLOSED MINDED! Create a VIRUS to scare people. Place them in quarantine. Count the number of dead every second of every day in every news headline. Close all businesses. 40,000,000 out of jobs. Peak unemployment. Remove entertainment: parks, gyms, bars, restaurants, sports. No dating. No touching. Mask people. Dehumanize them. Close temples and churches. Create a vaccine. Let depression and anxiety and desperation set in. THEN... ignite hatred and civil war. Civil unrest. Empty the prisons because of the virus and fill the streets with criminals. Send in Antifa to vandalize property as if they are freedom fighters. Undermine the law. Loot. Attack law enforcement, but tell government to order a stand-down. We are all being baited by adversarial governments who want to destroy America - China, Iran, Russia. And, in an election year, have Democrats blame all of it on the President. Can‚Äôt take America in a war, destroy it from within."

Neutral,@Jmteed,"Getting to the point where we all should stop paying our taxes. Schools closed, municipal offices shut down for over 5 months, businesses on lock down. What are we paying for?"
Positive,@flintbedrock,Wear a mask if you want to but let‚Äôs be clear about what it can and what it cannot do.
Positive,@ihatepeople,Why can‚Äôt they wear a mask like we‚Äôre told to do?
Positive,@BILLMCMICHEALS,"New Mexico seems like a nice place to not even try to drive through now.. if you do you,You better have your mask on in your vehicle!  @Dbongino   @Bonginoreport"
Positive,@c0lettea,"If anyone ever wondered how mob mentality took hold of 1600's Salem resulting in the torture and murders of so many innocent people.  Look no further than how many are reacting to COVID right now judging, hurting and even killing people over masks. IF these bullies REALLY and truly believe that their non-approved masks work and they are wearing them thereby protecting themselves from harm, then why are they so fixated on bullying everyone else? Now even trying to eat a burrito, OUTSIDE on a bench can result in an unprovoked attack of hot coffee thrown in your face by a virtue signaling social justice warrior without a clue. Not satisfied with throwing hot coffee in the face of an unsuspecting man just trying to eat his lunch, this clueless sjw went a step further and when he leapt up in his own defense hit him repeatedly, then called the police to report HIM for an assault."
Negative,@Bitemehard7,"I liberated 2 families just the other day. It was awesome to see the kids, as young as 3 take their masks off!!"

Neutral,@BeckerGOP,This is the most interesting mask video I've seen. How long until it's censored by Facebook?
Neutral,@BeardPluribusUnum,Basically...Masks don‚Äôt prevent the China virus.

Neutral,@CLJCPHT,Made this design for a mask when I‚Äôm forced to wear it. Now to make me one with Trump on it.

Neutral,@DylanWheeler511,Big thank you to whoever made this visual. And let‚Äôs not forget the holes are even bigger on the cloth masks....

Neutral,@JAndy777,"BREAKING: THERE IS A CURE FOR COVID-19 There is ""no need for masks"" because ""there is a cure"". You won't see this on any mainstream media outlet for obvious reasons. Liberals and the media desperately want this virus to persist. A cure for the virus now means the economy will bounce back quicker and stronger. This would greatly improve President Trump's bid at re-election. Full news conference from today can be watched @  #WWG1WGA"
Neutral,@AndySH,"A meager 4.5% economic growth is still movement in the right direction... The UK government should be allowing people to be back to normal, not imposing additional politically-motivated posturing on new mask regulations in shops. COVID is not a generation killer virus or pandemic! Can we all just agree that the governments are corrupt and trying to control us? We knew this anyway. Another attempt to take away freedoms. #covid #covid19 #covid19hoax #covidhoax #parlerUK #control #q #qanon"
Neutral,@DeplorableDebutante,"Today I got my first ""Could you put your mask over your nose?"" From a young woman that looked the same as she smelled, in a large department store. Since she said it to my back, I felt no need to turn around when I said ""No."" sternly back to her, and from the indignant huffing and clapping I could hear behind me, it sounded as if she was never told No in her life. The trick, I found, was to immediately tell the associate you're working with that the person is making -you- feel unsafe. It sends them into a tailspin where they don't know what to do for fear of offending someone that may spin into a ""Viral moment"".  It's actually hilarious."
Neutral,@Imthinking,Lousiana Attorney General Jeff Landry declares Gov. Bell Edward's executive order mask mandate to be null and void over it's unconstitutional and vague wording. According to Landry the order would put many business owners in position of enforcement leading to civil liability lawsuits. Landry clearly demonstrated that the order was completely unenforceable and worded so badly that no one could be charged a fine therefore placing government officials in a position to be sued should they attempt to fine anyone. #Louisiana #ParlerUSA #Politics
Neutral,@Denglishman,"In this show I cover the Obama administrations illegal spying on Trump. I cover Bill Gates & Dr. Fauchi along with their push for vaccines. I cover school reopening and the wearing of face masks and how they do not protect you. I cover HCQ and the fact there is a push to make this drug scarce even though the NIH deemed HCQ as the drug to kill COVID on August 22nd, 2005. I also shed light on the peaceful RIOTS and wonder why the left is complicit. It‚Äôs a long show but crammed full of data. I shoot these videos from start to finish with no editing. I was really tired and made one goof, I said birth certificate instead of death certificate.. LOL. New set looks great."
