Negative,@Fang1957,This is ridiculous! More testing = more cases! Deaths are down by 90% and that’s even assuming all the original ‘COVID’ deaths were actually from COVID. Most new cases are asymptomatic. It’s time for civil disobedience folks! No masks - no shutdowns - no more social distancing. Back to normal for the USA!

Neutral,@Aussiebrad,"More cases today in Victoria than the whole country had in a single day in March at the Australian peak of the covid-19... All because the state government let people leave quarantine without a test and sub-contractors with no training were used for security in the quarantine hotels... Ill keep repeating it. Victorians keep voting this CCP loving, extreme left government in. They can deal with a consequences."
Neutral,@Aussiebrad,"As usual, no data provided on hopitalisation or death rates.... But in all honest, this is why you dont shit where you eat. This was all caused by decisions made by the leftwing Victorian government.... Melbourne, you continue to vote the fools in, you can deal with the consequences of #lockdowns, Labor Party corruption, #ccp Belts and Roads initiative, #unemployment and #hightaxes.... the rest of #Australia shouldnt suffer. #auspol"
Neutral,@Joker1961,And according to our local deaths vs the regular flu it warrants no masks or shutdowns. This is woolens trying to socialize us
Positive,@ElvisKnight86,"These CoronaBro, Karen mask overloads are going to make me absolutely loose my patience. I don’t want to judge and I know it’s wrong, but my goodness people need to stop being so STUPID and ZOMBIFIED by these mask mandates. Sheeple, the same overlords telling you to mask up now, denied their validity just a few months ago."
Positive,@CajunBot2,"If 6' social distancing works, then why are masks required? If 6' distancing doesn't work, then why are we doinig it? If masks work, why is 6' spacing required? If Masks don't work, then why are some states requiring them? It's all a farce folks. It's election time and the democrats are playing politics with your health and wealth."
Positive,@deplorablez,I'm not sure she understands how masks work. Jim Jordan drops a truth bomb. #Spygate #obamagate #generalflynn #covid19 #maga
Positive,@DeltaJulietTango,As soon as Texas ordered mandatory mask wearing my theory of we’re all being played for the end goal. Mass Vaccination. Attach the Covid (Certificate of Vaccine ID) slowly overtime to everything of substance in order to force comply. Multiple layers of tracking every human on earth. Add in the DNA sample from every Covid test. Mission Complete. I dont give a shit about arrests. What I care about is the agenda. Civil war & BLM riots will be childs play if Patriots get Fooked.

Negative,@DylanWheeler511,Take your masks OFF!!!! This is a fairly easy experiment to duplicate. Masks appear to lower your environmental oxygen level SIGNIFICANTLY. Which would mean you're starving your brain for oxygen when you wear them. Meaning you’re slowly killing yourselves.

Negative,@Derek,Dr. Fauci was caught by Americas Voice News for taking his mask off when the hearing was over. You can’t make this up.

Neutral,@bwillis,Fuhrer Whitmer is now forcing business owners to confront their customers for not wearing masks under penalty of fine and suspension. Someone please get her out of Michigan before she destroys this state.
Neutral,@blondie2wild2001,So Facebook put me in jail because I posted that I haven't wore a mask this whole pandemic and have been tested twice and haven't had Covid-19. And I've been working with the public. Guess I didn't fit their scare tactic agenda.

Neutral,@Coastaltam,"So, our governor decided it would be a good idea to ban singing and chanting at churches - you know, because of the Virus™. Yet, over the weekend, there were still ""protestors"" standing on street corners shouting obscenities at people. And not even wearing mandated masks. The nerve.... WE sang in church on Sunday. And WE will sing again next Sunday. And WE will worship as we please. Faith binds and unites people. Gavin Newsom hates the thought of a united state and united people. #recall #recallnewsom2020 #california #1a"
