A few days ago I got creative and did some graphic design work from home, then threw together a website and created some merchandise with my (first) design. I'm on a mission to make some income from home, while at the same time supporting Trump by raising money towards his fight to keep his rightful position as our President! So from now through 12/10/2020, I will be donating 10% from all purchases from my store to Trump's cause. So if you could PLEASE echo the hell out of this, that would be so amazing!

If they cared about voter fraud, they could print off a list of everyone who committed it And if they cared about lowering crime they would have already made the world a safer and better place.

There's a constitutional process this course of events must follow. On top of that, Sidney Powell and Lin Woods (two of America's most powerful and peer-respected attorneys) are still pursuing their course of action with the full blessing of the White House and White House attorneys.

Fines of $1000 per person/ offence and up to $100,000.00 through the courts. Our freedom has been taken away and replaced with what I can only describe as despotism.  Fight for your president, fight for your freedom. American people are living in the last bastion of true freedom and it is jeopardy of falling to Marxism just like Canada has.

Limitations on family/friend gatherings before, during and beyond Thanksgiving. 6. Closures of places of worship. 7. Businesses being ordered to close, altered hours and limited customer capacity. All this comes at a time of election fraud and infringement upon our freedom of speech. Under the Biden administration, our right to bear arms would be tested like never before.

It's just your freedoms....gone forever.
Neutral,@CommunistsDeserveToDie,It‚Äôs just a mask. It‚Äôs just six feet. It‚Äôs just two weeks. It‚Äôs just non-essential businesses. It‚Äôs just non-essential workers. It‚Äôs just a bar. It‚Äôs just a restaurant. It‚Äôs just to keep from overwhelming the hospitals. It‚Äôs just until the cases go down. It‚Äôs just to flatten the curve. It‚Äôs just a few inmates. It‚Äôs just for a few more weeks. It‚Äôs just church. You could still pray. It‚Äôs just prayer. It‚Äôs just singing in church. It‚Äôs just until we get a vaccine. It‚Äôs just an app. It‚Äôs just for tracing. It‚Äôs just to let people know you‚Äôre safe to be around. It‚Äôs just to let others know who you‚Äôve been in contact with. It‚Äôs just a few more months. It‚Äôs just a video. It‚Äôs just a post. It‚Äôs just an email account. It‚Äôs just a Twitter/YouTube/Facebook account. It‚Äôs just for protecting others from hate speech. It‚Äôs just for protecting others from hurt feelings. It‚Äôs just a large gathering but for protests. It‚Äôs just some statues. It's just your freedoms....gone forever.
Neutral,@Chriscarini75,"Today I had the honor, on behalf of Hempstead Town Supervisor Don Clavin and the Town Board, to present Freeport Police Sergeant John Jacobsen with a Town of Hempstead #Hometownhero citation for his actions during the pandemic. As the pandemic began shutting down the Village, Jacobsen worked with the Emergency Management Team to ensure that Freeport officers were all equipped with the proper PPE to keep them safe while on the front lines. We were joined by Freeport Mayor Robert T. Kennedy and John‚Äôs son Joesph, who is currently a NYPD Police Officer. Thank you John for keeping the Freeport Police Department safe and thank you to the Village of Freeport Police Department for your efforts!"
