Their doing this by submitting lawsuits for allowing mail in voting because of Covid-19, allowing ballot harvesting, ease on signature verifications, allowing felons and prisoners to vote and working with Democratic governors to eliminate voter ID. What this will do is create so much chaos that we will not know who wins on election night. It will take weeks if not months to sort through the mess they have created; it might even have to go all the way to the SCOTUS. Now, during all this chaos the speaker of the house will assume the role of the president. That‚Äôs right Nancy Pelosi will assume the Presidential role, which could be as early as mid November.
