Neutral,conservative,@cherylRwalker,"If you’ve noticed, many state Governors are basing lockdowns on the percentage of ICU hospital beds being filled for determination of keeping us shut down. Has anybody noticed most ICU‘s only have a small number of units to start with? Especially in rural areas. So when it’s said, “Hospital ICU capacity is 90%,” it probably means 4 of the 5 beds available have been taken."
Neutral,conservative,@Joeoltmann,"For such a time as this... 2021 is the year of courage and resolve. It is the year of Patriots and truth. We will not allow the evil to destroy our country and enslave our people. If you do not think that is what they are trying to do, you are not paying attention. They are trying to weaken us as a nation from within... just a bit about their agenda: Abortions to destroy minority communities. “Gender fluidity” to destroy strength in men.  Socialism and communism pitched openly and frequently as if we should abandon opportunity and embrace mediocrity  Rhetoric of redistribution of wealth.  Mob rule... democracy, abandoning the very essence of what we truly are, a constitutional republic.  No police, no accountability and no consequences... followed by massive increases in violent crimes while leaders do nothing.  Lockdowns, killing over 200 million worldwide. This is just a taste of the leftist agenda... now we stand.  Happy New Year. Remember, God is at the wheel as we fight."
