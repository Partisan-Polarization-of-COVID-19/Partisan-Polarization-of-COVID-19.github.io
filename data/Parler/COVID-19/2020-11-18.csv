Negative,conservative,@Americas1776,The Hypocrisy! California Governor Gavin Newsom has been demanding people stay indoors and cancel holidays but meanwhile he was recently seen celebrating a birthday over dinner at a restaurant.  Truly disturbing to see these governors going against restrictions they put into place. This is all about control over the public.  #covid19hoax #liberalhypocrisy #covid #governor #liberalsmustgo #lockdown #maga #california #trump2020 #endthelockdown #covidrestrictions
Negative,conservative,@Chiaramonte,Who can explain this one?  With the second wave of lockdowns starting to roll in. I know for my state Big Gretch is trying to push us around again. Many people I know are not going to stand for it.  We know the virus is real.  We know we all have a risk.  But don’t tell us we can’t see our family for the holidays. That’s our call as a family to decide if the risk of being sick is worth it or not.  Not the Governments job. It’s ours.  #michiganlockdown  #covid19  #endthelockdown  ECHO IF YOU AGREE!

Neutral,conservative,@CommunistsDeserveToDie,"Pakistan is receiving $25 million in a package supposedly aimed to help America get through the shutdowns; $15 million is going to “democracy programs,” while another $10 million is being allocated towards unspecified “gender programs.” After receiving $25 million in the first COVID stimulus, the Kennedy Center is receiving $40 million for operations, maintenance, and renovations. Unsurprisingly, several senators and representatives, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are on the board. The bill is quite preoccupied with diversity endeavors within the government. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion of the Appropriations Committee are receiving $1.5 million. Further, the bill gives national intelligence 180 days to demonstrate “exercising hiring flexibilities” to “assure quality and diversity of the workforce.”"

During this entire crisis, when have the legislators actually written laws that people need to socially distance and wear masks — whether outside or in their own home with guests over — and had them signed by governors? Answer: NEVER. Not one time. The nonsense coming from the PA Secretary of Health today was never written by legislators, nor signed off on. It’s coming directly from führer Wolf in Harrisburg, whom last I knew has not returned to his office since March. His doors are shut, yet he CONTINUES TO BE PAID, giving edicts that have wreaked havoc for businesses and families in PA. It’s not just a mask.

History has many examples of those who desired world domination and conquest. They had their useful tools, who spread their covert wishes of oppression and power. All of them ultimately failed! Our President has shown that even the most at risk, initial casualties, can be treated and survive. ENOUGH of the use of your tools of oppression you leftist, socialist Democrats! We the People, WILL NOT comply and submit to you any longer! No longer will we be banished to our cells, no longer will we mask, no longer will we allow you to control us.

Answer: NEVER. Not one time. The nonsense coming from the PA Secretary of Health today was never written by legislators, nor signed off on. It’s coming directly from führer Wolf in Harrisburg, whom last I knew has not returned to his office since March. His doors are shut, yet he CONTINUES TO BE PAID, giving edicts that have wreaked havoc for businesses and families in PA. It’s not just a mask.

Neutral,conservative,@ColdHardTruth,"There is a body of evidence that suggests covid-19 WAS outside China before the early 2020 timeline that the so-called experts have established. This article is but another that contains information that sheds light on that school of thought. Unfortunately, the pandemic pushers do not want their narrative changed because they fear it will expose their linear thinking and unwillingness to explore other possibilities. Throughout history, the great scientists thought outside the box and explored all possibilities. What we have with Fauci and his allies are people who want to be right so badly that they are more often wrong."

Neutral,conservative,@GnostRexa,Tyrannical governments are good at two things: 1) Centralizing power to a level of their control and direct influence.  2) Retaining power once obtained. Right now Republicans have pushed for state and local governments to manage COVID response. For decades Republicans have pushed to reduce the size and influence of federal government on the citizens and their daily lives. Right now Democrat Governors have the harshest COVID restrictions. Democrats have been calling for almost a full year now for President Trump to centralize the power of COVID response at the federal level. The Democrat platform has consistently been for more government intervention and intrusion into our daily lives and control over everything.  Yet the media and Hollywood have maintained that Republicans are the tyrants and Nazis. And the best proof they are incorrect is that the media and Hollywood are still able to make these false claims despite multiple instances of Republican control of every branch.

Neutral,conservative,@ColdHardTruth,"COVID testing is being done with the specific goal of showing massive infection rates.  The only way to control the population is with fear and fear mandated restrictions. Everywhere I go, every store, gas station, grocery store, or any place people gather, I see masks. Hell, it's actually strange to see someone without one any more. Private businesses are requiring them, public places are requiring them, and cooperation among the population appears to be very high. SO, IF MASKS ARE OUR BEST DEFENSE AGAINST COVID-19, WHY ARE WE SEEING THESE MASSIVE INFECTION NUMBERS?"

Our star of David will be an app or tattoo or paperwork saying we have been vaccinated or tested. The result will be the same...concentration camps and starving those who don't comply. KEEP WEARING THE MASKS YOU IDIOTS...THEY LITERALLY DO NOTHING TO STOP COVID.

Also... if masks work why are people still getting it? Just live your life and take the precautions think you need but the rest of us don’t need to bullied by a government... it’s my life... not the governments.
Neutral,conservative,@ColdHardTruth,"The number of cycles effects the result. Most real scientists say between 30 to 34 cycles is sufficient to return an accurate result of a person with active virus requiring attention/quarantine. Current testing is being done at 80 plus cycles that picks up fragments, or even inert COVID cells. There is no way of telling how many positive results being returned should actually have been negative!"

They don’t want private businesses, they don’t want you to have any private property, they want to implement Universal Basic Income and other Socialist policies - and they want everyone vaccinated with the Bill Gates mRNA vaccine more than once.

Neutral,conservative,@AndieMills311,"I'm curious how others feel about Covid closing schools down. Maybe we should stop fighting so hard to have our kids put back into these public school indoctrination centers, and fight for school choice in order for the money to follow the kids to private, Catholic, Christian, home-schooling, and charter schools? Or, should we continue to fight to have the public schools opened back up?  This is a tough one, because parents need to work, and in most cases it's impossible for them to do so if their children are at home. I'm fortunate enough to live in Texas where we DO have school choice; however, I know a lot of people don't have these options. I am all for taking our children out of the hands of these liberal school systems.  I think we failed when we let the liberals take over public education, universities, and the media. They've worked on these takeovers for decades, so it can't be solved over night. Thoughts?"

Our President has shown that even the most at risk, initial casualties, can be treated and survive. ENOUGH of the use of your tools of oppression you leftist, socialist Democrats! We the People, WILL NOT comply and submit to you any longer! No longer will we be banished to our cells, no longer will we mask, no longer will we allow you to control us.

Neutral,conservative,@CommunistsDeserveToDie,"Pakistan is receiving $25 million in a package supposedly aimed to help America get through the shutdowns; $15 million is going to “democracy programs,” while another $10 million is being allocated towards unspecified “gender programs.” After receiving $25 million in the first COVID stimulus, the Kennedy Center is receiving $40 million for operations, maintenance, and renovations. Unsurprisingly, several senators and representatives, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are on the board. The bill is quite preoccupied with diversity endeavors within the government. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion of the Appropriations Committee are receiving $1.5 million. Further, the bill gives national intelligence 180 days to demonstrate “exercising hiring flexibilities” to “assure quality and diversity of the workforce.”"

Or did they just buy whatever he said because “Orange Man Bad”. I am throughly disgusted with people who do not think, this is about your livelihood, it’s about your children’s and grandchildren’s futures. Who cares whether you like the way Orange Man combs his hair, are you all really that shallow?!? Why the f@#$ would anyone vote for someone who says, “Americans don’t need to know if I’ll pack the court”; who says “I have a plan to handle CoVid” but won’t tell you anything about that “plan”. How can anyone be surprised when his plan is more of what hasn’t worked for the last nine months. People can be so stupid."
Neutral,conservative,@DylanWheeler511,"It makes me sick. Most Trump supporters know the virus is a joke & the vax Trump is pushing will modify people’s DNA. But they simply don’t care. They keep saying it won’t be mandatory so it’s not a big deal. But that couldn’t be further from the truth.... It’s a HUGE deal. Do they not care about the well-being of their family & friends or the tens of millions of other people who are about to take this poisonous cocktail thinking they need it? Do they not care that Trump is the one pushing this abomination on them? Where is their compassion or common sense? And once again, Trump doesn’t need to mandate the vax when the schools, hospitals, airlines, sporting events, places of business, & etc. will all begin to mandate a Covid proof of vax record. Life will become extremely difficult for anyone who doesn’t want to inject themselves with that poison. And when that times comes just remember who championed the vaccine in the first place with Operation Warp Speed & the military."

He is corrupt, a liar, suffering from dementia and in my opinion a pedophile. He has done nothing to improve anything in 47/48 years in politics. I truly believe Biden is just the stepping stone for Kamala Harris to take over the White House. Nancy Pelosi is already trying to put a 25th amendment in place to remove an unfit president. I don’t believe that has a thing to do with Trump having Covid. I think that’s to remove Biden if elected for dementia and Harris to take over. This is my opinion so don’t bother to bash it, I haven’t bashed yours. The 3 time Nobel Prize nominee in the White House just brokered two Middle East Peace Accords, something that 71 years of political intervention and endless war failed to produce.

Speaking on Wednesday, French Europe Minister Clement Beaune said “a solution will be found in the coming weeks” despite the issues that prompted the two member states to block the EU’s €1.8 trillion ($2.1 trillion) financial package. The budget includes a large Covid-19 economic recovery plan.
