Negative,conservative,@Americas1776,LOCKDOWN Scam!  The first wave of lockdown was to crush the local businesses and this final wave of lockdowns is to finish off those businesses. This virus is all made up and has been blown way out of proportion.  They are doing this to make independent employment nearly impossible and make everyone dependent on the government. THIS IS ALL ABOUT CONTROL!!!!! ECHO this!

Negative,conservative,@bpeterssquare,"America used to be the land of the free and the home of the brave. Now we are the land of lockdowns and home of the afraid.  How do you think the Democrats kept their slaves on the plantation in chains? FEAR.  The former slave owning Democrats made their slaves terrified of what would happen to them if they tried to escape. And even if they did, the slave was told they were incapable of surviving without their white master.  Is this any different than the FEAR used by Democrats to lock you down in your home like a slave?  Tyrants, dictators and totalitarians have only one tool for control; FEAR.  Democrats have always been this way.  This is a second lockdown for some. Do you really think they will stop here?  Are you free?  Are you brave?  Or are you allowing the FEAR they‚Äôre selling you to place chains on your freedom?  #lockdown #endthelockdown #resisttyranny #masksareforslaves #nomasks #covid19 #pandemic #coronavirus #coronavirushoax #election2020 #electionfraud"

Negative,conservative,@bpeterssquare,"Carbon dioxide does not only cause asphyxiation by hypoxia but also acts as a toxicant. At high concentrations, it has been showed to cause unconsciousness almost instantaneously and respiratory arrest within 1 min.  The term ‚Äúconfined space hypoxic syndrome‚Äù has been proposed to describe confined space accidents occurring in water meter pits, tanks, holds of ships, mines, underground storage bins, and so forth, resulting from oxygen-deficient atmospheres.  A recent study of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 2015 still estimated the number of deaths involving confined spaces to be around 90 per year.  Without adequate treatment, victims may show acute reduced cognitive performance, respiratory failure, and circulatory arrest. #nomasks #masksdontwork #masksareforslaves #election2020 #covd19 #pandemic #coronavirus #coronavirushoax #lockdown #endthelockdown #endtheshutdown #reopenamerica #health #wellness #fightback #patriotsfight #maga #wewillwin"

Neutral,conservative,@Conservattorney,"As we continue to be bombarded by the media pushing a Biden White House, we hear about mask mandates and shutdowns.  What the news media refuse to report is that mask mandates do not work, and in fact may be contributing to the spread of COVID.  Don't believe me, then read this report BY THE CDC and buried on their own website:  Mask wearers will touch their face on a more consistent basis than non-mask wearers. We know the virus enters the body through the mouth and nose. Additional reports indicate that transmission via ""droplets in the air"" are highly unlikely as they are nearly impossible to detect even in lab conditions. But touching your face repeatedly to put your mask on, take it off, adjust it, etc. brings your hands close to your mouth and nose, thus making it easier for the virus to come in contact or close proximity to susceptible membranes.  So the question is, why keep pushing mask mandates?"

We don't tell people not to celebrate holidays because of drug overdoses. We don't shut down businesses that sell smoking products. Yet cars, drugs, and smoking related deaths kill hundreds more every day and we accept those risks. Wake up. The election was a fraud perpetrated by swamp dwellers. You can't trust the government.

While the day before the dance in the streets with thousands. They closed our church's because of gatherings They gather and march to protest. This in no longer about your safety. This is a attempt to control you, and its working. The best way to take control over a people and control them utterly is to take a little of their freedom at a time, to erode rights by a thousand tiny and almost imperceptible reductions. In this way, the people will not see those rights and freedoms being removed until past the point at which these changes cannot be reversed...  Echo..echo..echo.."

At high concentrations, it has been showed to cause unconsciousness almost instantaneously and respiratory arrest within 1 min.  The term ‚Äúconfined space hypoxic syndrome‚Äù has been proposed to describe confined space accidents occurring in water meter pits, tanks, holds of ships, mines, underground storage bins, and so forth, resulting from oxygen-deficient atmospheres.  A recent study of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in 2015 still estimated the number of deaths involving confined spaces to be around 90 per year.

Negative,conservative,@Arcorey,Now is the time to follow your gut and not your ears and eyes. Fauci is part of this whole mess and a member of the swamp. His stories don‚Äôt jive. Time to take off your masks and re-read the constitution. You have to ask yourselves why we‚Äôre closing down everything for a 98% survivable virus.
Neutral,conservative,@AndyJAllen,"Anytime you debate a mask warrior; tell them these easily provable factoids. Virus particles are as small as 30 nanometers. The pores in an N95 mask are as big as 300 nanometers. Every time you exhale you release aerosol particles that quickly evaporate and release their contents into the air (picture seeing your breath in winter time). Furthermore, masks don't make a perfect seal to your face and air flows around the perimeter (because air flow will choose the path of least resistance). Wearing a mask is nothing more than a symbol of ignorance and obedience."
Neutral,conservative,@Dhirsch7376,"Dr. Fauci: 'Obvious' It Would Better to Start Transition   Actually, what is ""obvious"" is that Dr. Fauci refuses to ""follow the science."" He has his mind made up--may be politically motivated may not--but he has closed his mind to the outside scientific community. A report published recently in the American Journal of Physics showed masks do not work! A recent study (yet to be published) out of Denmark shows that masks and social distancing do not control the spread of Covid-19. Masks and SD are merely safety blankets. The cases keep rising BECAUSE of masks. Think about that! Wake up America and start fighting back on this CCP virus scam."

Neutral,conservative,@Freevortex1,"I for one am sick and tired of seeing and hearing this idiot! The masks do not work! We measure small particles in microns and nanometers typically. A micron is 1/25,400ths of an inch, a nanometer is 1/1000000000 meters. Dust mites and allergens are 0.1 to 100 nanometers. The gift we were given from Asia is 60-140 nanometers, for the piece I will not split the baby and will use 0.1 micron as the size of this virus because particulate matter in the 0.1 micron size act more like a gas than a particle (hold your breath). A mask does not work!"
Neutral,conservative,@Anie,"Just another power hungry governor in another blue state. So over it. Virginia has had a mask mandate since May. Wasn‚Äôt that and the stupid lockdown supposed to make it disappear? Newsflash. The virus isn‚Äôt going anywhere. It‚Äôs here to stay. Enough is enough. I‚Äôm sure an expanded mask mandate, not allowing groups of more than 25 and not serving alcohol past 10 pm will nip it right in the bud.
