Neutral,conservative,@DylanWheeler511,"An apartment complex in Ventura County, CA is locking their residents inside the building until all of them are tested for Covid. I called the number, was put on hold, & then eventually forwarded to voicemail. This is the dangerous slope we’ve been talking about - & it’s exactly what the Cabal wants. They don’t even have to mandate laws or draft legislation when landlords, banks, businesses, etc. will go along with the agenda & require this out of their tenants /customers. And what happens if 1 child tests positive in a public school setting? Will they lockdown that entire school until every kid is forcefully tested then shipped to a “quarantine facility” if positive? This is called tyranny & it never ends up well for us citizens. It’s time to wake up & fight for our God-given rights. #WWG1WGA"

Positive,conservative,@GinaGrote225,"Its your responsibility to protect yourself...for instance, wearing a seatbelt...your responsibility, right? You can’t rely on someone not smashing into you. So you do it.  Wear a mask to protect yourself if you’re vulnerable, for the same reason...for those who don’t wear them. It’s not my responsibility to make sure you’re safe, it’s yours.  If everyone acted in their own self interest this would be a non issue. And don’t bitch about people who don’t wear one....just keep your distance."

Negative,conservative,@AshleyWiebenga,"Since I had some people criticize my homemade mask, and some people made some respectful and valid points, I decided to get a new one. My reason for masking is, 1) If I am asked to, I will wear it, no questions asked, no complaints. This goes for business or people.  2) If I know I'm going to be around people of the vulnerable population. 3) Places that it is absolutely necessary (medical facilities). I still don't agree will the science about them, but I'm not going to be an ass. I prefer not to wear it, but if I have to, I will make a statement. 😊 @TeamTrump #michigan #nomasks #standup #masks #govwhitmer #gretchenwhitmer #executiveorder #maga #kag #trump2020 #freemichigan #protest"

Negative,conservative,@bpeterssquare,Millions of parents are deciding to home school their children this coming year rather than put them in public schools under strict CDC guidelines. Development happens only once and I will not be placing my child in a public school under those guidelines. I do not feel that is the proper environment for a child. Until the schools improve their services I will be keeping my child’s development under my care.  - - - #SAVETHECHILDREN #OBAMAGATE #WWG1WGA #qanon #darktolight #followthewhiterabbit #thegreatawakening #socialdistancing #thestormishere #thinkforyourself #patriotsfight #alonetogether #quarantinelife #Godwins #trumptweets #memewar #trumptrain #digitalsoldier #keyboardwarrior #blacklivesmatter #NWO #draintheswamp #sheepnomore #coronavirus #deplorable #buildthewall #covid19 #deepstate #truthseeker #kek #news #truth #masks #qarmy #covfefe #maga #usa #qsoldier #america #history #maga2020  #trump2020  #homeschool  #homeschooling  #schoolchoice  #takebackourschools  #openschools

Neutral,conservative,@ighaworth,"""The goal here should be to find an effective balance between caution and normalcy, protecting both public health and economic health. The use of masks in indoor public areas is an effective and comparatively effortless part of this balance. The fact that masks have become a political battleground is a travesty for which the blame must fall upon our politicians. I hope those who oppose masks are right. I fear they are wrong.""

Neutral,conservative,@janlange,♦️It’s just a Mask...  It’s just for two weeks.  It’s just non-essential businesses.  It’s just to keep from overwhelming hospitals.  It’s just until cases go down.  It’s just to keep others from being afraid.  It’s just for a few more weeks.  It’s just until we get a vaccine.  It’s just a few side effects.  It’s just a bracelet to let people know you’re safe to be around.  It’s just an app.  It’s just to let others know who you’ve been in contact with.  It’s just a few more months.  It’s just a video.  It’s just a few people.  It’s just a little chip.  It’s just for medical information or buying something.  It’s just so you can travel.  It’s just a clump of cells.  It’s just a statue. It’s just a building. It’s just a song. It’s just a book. It’s just a movie. It’s just a piece of cloth. It’s just a flag.  It’s just the Jews.  It’s just the undesirables.  It’s just the men.  It’s just the Christians.  It’s just.... wait.... it’s NOT just a mask!
