Positive,conservative,@Jeanna929017376560,As a COVID survivor I really have mixed emotions on this. I wear a mask to protect myself because I don‚Äôt ever want to be that sick again. I can‚Äôt stay home. I have to work and buy groceries. So I have to be out and about. I honestly don‚Äôt know what the answer is on all of this.
Positive,conservative,@BeliveInAmerica,"We cannot let these animals run the streets of America. When we have a rally we need to show up like they do. Conservatives showing up for a peaceful demonstration, must be prepared to defend each other or don‚Äôt have a rally, stay home and take your medicine. We cannot stand for a single fellow demonstrator being attacked by the gang of cowards and basement dwellers, the exact reason Lunch Bucket Joe identifies with them. We are Americans, that used to mean something to all of us."
Positive,conservative,@Candice23,I think people should only vote if they have a job or cannot have a job (due to disability or other circumstances). Of course being a stay at home mom or dad counts as a job! You all know what I mean by government handouts and people that just don‚Äôt do anything and still get money off the government.
Positive,conservative,@191powm,"President-elect Joe Biden has floated a nationwide lockdown and mask mandate in response to surging coronavirus cases across the country. But even if he follows through and orders all Americans to stay at home and cover their faces when in public, don‚Äôt expect to see those mandates enforced in South Dakota. The office of Gov. Kristi Noem said in a statement to the Argus Leader Friday that the first-term governor, who‚Äôs risen to stardom in the Republican party for her hands-off approach to managing the pandemic, has no intention of using state resources to enforce any federal COVID-19 orders."
Neutral,conservative,@AbbyJohnsonOfficial,"It‚Äôs time for every church in America to defy lockdown, quarantine and any other orders related to this virus. People need to be in Church. They need to fellowship with other believers. They NEED hope. They need Jesus. Stop cowering to the government. Stand up and fight."

Neutral,conservative,@Army79,"In June Fort Benning did everything necessary to prevent COVID-19 spread. They quarantined recruits 14 days, tested and retested after 14 days. Wore masks even while sleeping. Still recruits were infected after another test a week or 2 later. So this study is no surprise."
Neutral,conservative,@Bonita,"Marches or Car rallies are being held all over California. If we leave California, Gov Newsom says we have to self quarantine. But we have people living in Mexico who cross every day into San Diego because that‚Äôs where they work. 22% of new cases in the county were spread by those is what county officials said. We are on the most restrictive tier now for at least 3 weeks."

Neutral,conservative,@Freevortex1,"I for one am sick and tired of seeing and hearing this idiot! The masks do not work! We measure small particles in microns and nanometers typically. A micron is 1/25,400ths of an inch, a nanometer is 1/1000000000 meters. Dust mites and allergens are 0.1 to 100 nanometers. The gift we were given from Asia is 60-140 nanometers, for the piece I will not split the baby and will use 0.1 micron as the size of this virus because particulate matter in the 0.1 micron size act more like a gas than a particle (hold your breath).

Neutral,conservative,@Acidfast1,"Masks have never worked, but that was clear when they mandated them. Mandates are ANTI-SCIENCE. False Sense of Security only magnifies.
