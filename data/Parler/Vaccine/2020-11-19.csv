Did you stop to think that maybe someone, who you infected, died from complications due to the Flu? Are you now going to hold the responsibility for their death? You knew someone could die from the Flu and you didn't protect them...how many people have you now killed over your lifetime? There's no end game to the scenario as a Virus is going to be deadly to someone. How long are you willing to wear a mask for? The rest of your life? For which Viruses?"

Ok so they want to stay home and maybe zoom their kids what once a week? Or a short time a day. Well then they should only get paid for that short time the parents should get the rest of their pay!!! And talk about stressed what about the kids that love school and want to learn from the teacher they love. What about them dear teachers (not all of you I know many that want to be with their kids) but those that want paid but not really work. Also remember this they get paid for their summers off and would be ok if when school is on they worked. Sooo many in service I suppose necessary although when I was a kid I learned and teachers didn’t do these!!! Wake up teacher use your masks wash hands and tech our kids period.

He will not have the power to do that. Shows how stupid he really is! Closing down again is not the answer. There are still people who now do not have jobs because of the first shutdown. People should have the freedom to work or run their business. If you are so afraid of covid you can quit your job or not patronize a business and stay scared in your home like Biden did.

More an more discussions regarding the possibility of another lockdown have been popping up everywhere...Take a look at what's going on in Chicago, it's starting. I hope people are realizing that no matter who gets in office, the results are the same! It's coming folks, prepare now and get things in order as best you can.  What I think might happen is that we may not see an official announcement of it declared, so as to not cause too much panic, but just a steady continuous flow of restrictions and limitations/curfews etc pouring in, state by state. Until you stop and look around and see that darn... This is the second nationwide lockdown after all."

Neutral,conservative,@Conservattorney,"Good morning fellow patriots! As we hear about more and more lockdowns pushed by people who have no concerns for small businesses, there is something small businesses can do. If you are a small business owner then let people know your store is a ""mask free zone"" or ""mask optional zone"". Do not shutter your doors. Do not make your staff wear masks. Welcome the community in. If you have to, disobey local ordinances and put up signs stating your business is staying open as a ""peaceful protest"" against the lockdowns.  If we resist in a peaceful manner, but remain steadfast we can beat this maniacal governors and wanna-be dictators.  Why should you be put out of business so somebody, somewhere with no relationship to you may or may not live if they happen to catch COVID; after all they have a 99.95% chance of surviving COVID whereas you have a 99.95% chance of having your business killed by shutting down."

The Democrat governor’s pay is going up by $25,000, bumping his salary from $225,000 to $250,000 all during a financial crisis in the state due to the coronavirus pandemic. Just one month ago, Cuomo outlined the dire situation New York was seeing itself in due to reduced revenue amid numerous shutdowns in the state. “New York state is already $50 billion in debt between state and local governments and they have not passed legislation on the state and local relief,” Gov. Cuomo stated. “If the state has a deficit and the local governments have a deficit, we can’t fund essential workers.”"

Is your point of standing up saying no to a mask mandate (as compared to making your own choice in a situation to wear or not wear a mask) or do you wait to they come to you say you must have “this vaccine” to work, travel. Or do you stand up to them when they tell you that you must give up any guns you own. It is much easier to stand up and resist now as a population to unmask ..... all we have to do is stand up against all of this and it will stop ... if not it gets much more painful down the road to draw the line in the future."

There is absolutely nothing that can be done to contain this virus, other than protecting the older more vulnerable people. It should be thought of as nothing more than a bad flu season. This is not Ebola, it’s not SARS. Masks are utterly useless. There is no evidence basis for their effectiveness whatsoever. Paper masks and fabric masks are simply virtue signaling. They’re not even work effectively most of the time. It is utterly ridiculous seeing these unfortunate, uneducated people, I’m not saying that in a pejorative sense, these people walking around like lemmings obeying without knowledge based to put the mask on their face.

Neutral,conservative,@Conservattorney,"Good morning fellow patriots! As we hear about more and more lockdowns pushed by people who have no concerns for small businesses, there is something small businesses can do. If you are a small business owner then let people know your store is a ""mask free zone"" or ""mask optional zone"". Do not shutter your doors. Do not make your staff wear masks. Welcome the community in. If you have to, disobey local ordinances and put up signs stating your business is staying open as a ""peaceful protest"" against the lockdowns.  If we resist in a peaceful manner, but remain steadfast we can beat this maniacal governors and wanna-be dictators.  Why should you be put out of business so somebody, somewhere with no relationship to you may or may not live if they happen to catch COVID; after all they have a 99.95% chance of surviving COVID whereas you have a 99.95% chance of having your business killed by shutting down."
Neutral,conservative,@Ianfelpel,"I’ve said it before, and will say it again: Is #covid19 real? YES. I know people who caught it. Some got hit hard or died with it, while others were asymptomatic. We should be sensitive to those who have lost loved ones from it, as well as those who are afraid. I’m also not against a #vaccine, so long as it’s not made mandatory, and is actually effective. So what am I against here? Fearmongering. Politicization. #lockdowns. Arrests for anyone who isn’t social distancing, isn’t wearing masks, or is having social gatherings. I’m especially against making masks mandatory for in the home, even when having friends or family over. Still think it’s just a mask? No: this is about #control. #fascism. #tyranny. #biggovernment. Even talk of #thegreatreset. The radical left doesn’t love you, nor care about your health, safety, and well-being. They don’t even want #unity. They only care that you give them your #power. #resist. #stopcomplying. #fightforfreedom."
Neutral,conservative,@BellaPhoenix,"I've known this since March 2020 and kept getting shut down on Twatter and FB for trying to get facts out to people. I deleted my account on both sites because truth is very important to me, as is my 1st amendment right. Standard masks don't stop Covid and can significantly decrease people's ability to fight off any virus, including more common ones. There are also safe and inexpensive drugs available that have been being used to effectively treat Covid patients. Lastly, the actual Covid death numbers being reported are highly exaggerated, seriously flawed, and are being investigated. Aside from the science that you can research, ask yourself this: If a mask protects people against Covid, Why should anyone worry whether you are wearing one or not? Their mask should keep them safe right? Covid is a political weapon being used by Globalists. Stand up for yourselves, for your families, and for Freedom. We will beat this if we remember to Stand United across the World. WWG1WGA."
Neutral,conservative,@AJtLH,"We still see politicians calling for closures of businesses and now beginning to police mask wearing and ""social distancing"" while we now know it's all ineffective.  The CDC website has an article with a data table attached that shows, something like, 72.2% of people who tested positive reported wearing a mask all the time and another 14% reported wearing a mask either all the time, or most of the time.  Medications that we know work against COVID-19 are still being denied. The President has called for therapeutics to be made widely available and they have resisted him at every turn. The important question is why? If you've been a life long observer of politics, as I have, and you are an astute observer of the current political climate in our nation the answer becomes painfully obvious.  Ask yourself, why did the WHO and prominent Democrats resist the presidents efforts to stop travel from a highly infected China? The WHO going as far as to assert the falsehood that China had COVID-19"

The over 3,000 participants were divided into two study groups, and those who tested positive up front were removed from the group on day 1. By day 14, spread was actually greater among those in the supervised quarantine group (2.8%) than in the control group (1.7%)."""

Same with the flu, we know this. Smoking kills way more people every year, but people don't stop. Why have we let this stop our lives? Pregnant women can't have the fathers of their unborn child with them at their OB appointments because COVID. Single mamas who have no other option but to bring their child with them to the doctor are made to reschedule because COVID. If a mask is required and it's so effective, why can't you have the father of your baby with you? Or your child? And you know what else is crazy to me?"
Neutral,conservative,@brathman48,Ok I am pry going to open a bag of worms but I am always for our teachers of our kids and grandkids but when they want school to be closed due to this pandemic because they are so stressed makes my blood boil. Ok so they want to stay home and maybe zoom their kids what once a week? Or a short time a day. Well then they should only get paid for that short time the parents should get the rest of their pay!!! And talk about stressed what about the kids that love school and want to learn from the teacher they love. What about them dear teachers (not all of you I know many that want to be with their kids) but those that want paid but not really work. Also remember this they get paid for their summers off and would be ok if when school is on they worked. Sooo many in service I suppose necessary although when I was a kid I learned and teachers didn’t do these!!! Wake up teacher use your masks wash hands and tech our kids period.

Those interim results were based on only NINETY-FIVE PEOPLE who got Covid, out of 30,000 in the trials. Of those 95 people who got sick, only 5 had received the vaccine.  BUT.

But what about between now and when the vaccine starts to hit the street (elderly and sick first). Will the lockdowns go back in place and the economy bottoms out. If biden wins will he say the vacvine is no good so the economy stays tanked.  My problem with all of this is Trump took the database away from CDC and gave it to DHHS. The CDC admits the death and case counts are wsy to high, yet the media still uses the old data.   See Ron Pauls report on whats wrong with covid"

Rather, it’s a MEDIA Release statement by Pfizer.  ♦️The news that the vaccine is “90% effective” has sent Pfizer stocks flying & caused the company’s EX-VETERINARIAN chairman, Dr Albert Bourla, to sell off 62% of his personal stock in Pfizer. The share sale was apparently tripped by an automated system set up in August when the share value hit a given price."
