Neutral,conservative,@AussieG,I don‚Äôt know my country anymore. üòû A pregnant woman arrested for a Facebook post. Served a warrant to search and seize property in her home. Charged with incitement for organising a peaceful protest in her neighbourhood against these draconian lockdowns in Melbourne. This is not the Australia I grew up in or voted on you. Shame on you all.  #melbournelockdown #melbourne #wwg1wga
Neutral,conservative,@AdamJohnson,"Okay, my take on #Salongate . Nancy Pelosi has been mostly in San Francisco for the duration of lockdowns. It's why the WH keeps asking ""where's Nancy Pelosi"". But when she does pop up elsewhere, she's well-coiffed. This CAN'T be the first time she's done this. Just the first time she's gotten caught. And this stylist renting the chair has probably been the one doing it the whole time. Pelosi herself has said she's been to this salon many times. She just thought they would continue to break the rules for her without any influx of cash from other less privileged customers coming in and would continue to keep their mouths shut. Surprise, people need their businesses to thrive in order to eat."

Wearing a cloth on your face for 20 minutes isn't the equivalent to your rights being taken away you piss hole. AND AFTER SAYING THAT BULLSHIT, YOU HAVE THE AUDACITY TO CALL US SNOWFLAKES FOR STANDING UP FOR HUMAN RIGHTS- Ah yes, fuck human rights, the masks we wear for twenty minutes that are protecting the people around us are the problem.

Positive,conservative,@Brb0702,"Forgive me, but I just have to rant. I'm so angry and disgusted. So let me get this straight, Kamala LaLa can threaten the USA, ON PUBLIC TV, saying that her and her other treasonous ""power hungry whores"" along with their illiterate punks arent stopping now or after the election, they will never stop. That we the people should take note of that and be warned. BUT SHES NOT BEING ARRESTED FOR THREATENING THE USA AND HER PEOPLE AND BEING CHARGED WITH TEASON? WHY NOT?  She is a ""possible"" elected VP or President! Someone better be doing something to this woman and her cronies.  Nancy Pelosi.....she doesnt havent to wear a mask while out, but sure tries to play THE GOOD WITCH on tv and she can even have a hair salon open just for her, like Beetle Juice did?  I'm so tired of this crap! These state officials, so blatantly and in our faces, with what they are allowing to be done and involved in themselves, but yet, face no consequences.
