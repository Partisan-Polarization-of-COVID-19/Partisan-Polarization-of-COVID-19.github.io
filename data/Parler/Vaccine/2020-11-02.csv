Negative,conservative,@FreeEarthlings,"Dr. #ReinerFuellmich on #PCRtestScandal  The #Covid19Crisis must be renamed a #CoronaScandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages. How dangerous is the virus? What is the significance of a positive #PCRtest? What is the collateral damage with respect to #health and #economy? An international network of lawyers will argue the biggest #TortCase ever - the #CoronaFraudScandal - which has unfolded into probably the greatest #CrimesAgainstHumanity ever committed. #Scientists and #lawyers recognise that as a result of the deliberate panic-mongering and the corona measures enabled by this panic, #democracy is in great danger of being replaced by #FascistTotalitarian models. To make sure that no one will ever again be in a position of such power as to be able to defraud humanity, or to attempt to manipulate us with their corrupt agendas. #SaveTheEconomy #DefendHumanity #EndLockdowns  #MakeLawLawfulAgain  #GetOffOurRights"

Neutral,conservative,@buskirk,Here is Fauci confirming that transmission of respiratory viruses by asymptomatic viruses is very rare and is NEVER the driver of outbreaks. So why are public health authorities issuing guidance to treat asymptomatic people as if they are major vectors of viral transmission? That is one of the premises of lockdowns and quarantines.

So if masks worked how did 400 chat catch the virus.
Neutral,conservative,@E4foundation,"Hello friends on Parler! As most of you know, due to COVID (and the associated lockdowns and nonsense that have gone along with it), things like singing and choruses have almost entirely been eliminated. From one moment to the next, choirs and choruses across the country have been forced to stop singing together as potential ‚Äúsuper spreaders‚Äù. Despite all of this, we are NOT disheartened and are finding new ways to stay connected and sing. So this Christmas, please consider sending a virtual choir Christmas card to your family and friends at the below link. Not only is it a great way to tell your family that you are thinking of them this Christmas but it will help support my chorus and help it stay alive until we can all get back together again in harmony. In addition, you‚Äôll be supporting a 501-C3 organization and it is fully tax deductible! Win Win all the way around! Thank you all for checking it out and Merry Christmas!"

The shutdown at the Pineapple Hill Grill & Saloon in the city‚Äôs Sherman Oaks neighborhood came amid a county-ordered ban on outdoor dining, a mayor-issued stay-at-home order -- and California state-level plans for business shutdowns if coronavirus hospitalizations hit required levels."

Neutral,conservative,@Derek,Politicians who advocate for more shutdowns simply don‚Äôt understand how economics work.  You don‚Äôt get to decide what business are essential or non-essential.  Non-essential workers will run out of money and stimulus to be able to pay for essential goods and services.

Mask mandates are unconstitutional executive edicts forced upon citizens essentially retroactively because of where you happen to live. Nobody voted for this governmental behavior.  In fact, the vast majority of us just voted against this sort of authoritarian rule in the last election with sweeping wins in the House and state legislatures DESPITE the WIDESPREAD election fraud, voter fraud, and calculated electronic manipulations.  It‚Äôs time to drop the mask guys... Some might get asked to leave stores.  Some might get arrested.  But this needs to happen.  The masks are about control, compliance, and division.  So, open your business, drop the mask, and live your life. I think we‚Äôve got bigger problems in our country than a glorified cold. üá∫üá∏ #standupforamerica"
