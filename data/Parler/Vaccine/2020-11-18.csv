Negative,conservative,@Americas1776,The Hypocrisy! California Governor Gavin Newsom has been demanding people stay indoors and cancel holidays but meanwhile he was recently seen celebrating a birthday over dinner at a restaurant.  Truly disturbing to see these governors going against restrictions they put into place. This is all about control over the public.  #covid19hoax #liberalhypocrisy #covid #governor #liberalsmustgo #lockdown #maga #california #trump2020 #endthelockdown #covidrestrictions
Negative,conservative,@Chiaramonte,Who can explain this one?  With the second wave of lockdowns starting to roll in. I know for my state Big Gretch is trying to push us around again. Many people I know are not going to stand for it.  We know the virus is real.  We know we all have a risk.  But don’t tell us we can’t see our family for the holidays. That’s our call as a family to decide if the risk of being sick is worth it or not.  Not the Governments job. It’s ours.  #michiganlockdown  #covid19  #endthelockdown  ECHO IF YOU AGREE!

Neutral,conservative,@CommunistsDeserveToDie,"Pakistan is receiving $25 million in a package supposedly aimed to help America get through the shutdowns; $15 million is going to “democracy programs,” while another $10 million is being allocated towards unspecified “gender programs.” After receiving $25 million in the first COVID stimulus, the Kennedy Center is receiving $40 million for operations, maintenance, and renovations. Unsurprisingly, several senators and representatives, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., are on the board. The bill is quite preoccupied with diversity endeavors within the government. The Office of Diversity and Inclusion of the Appropriations Committee are receiving $1.5 million. Further, the bill gives national intelligence 180 days to demonstrate “exercising hiring flexibilities” to “assure quality and diversity of the workforce.”"

During this entire crisis, when have the legislators actually written laws that people need to socially distance and wear masks — whether outside or in their own home with guests over — and had them signed by governors? Answer: NEVER. Not one time. The nonsense coming from the PA Secretary of Health today was never written by legislators, nor signed off on. It’s coming directly from führer Wolf in Harrisburg, whom last I knew has not returned to his office since March. His doors are shut, yet he CONTINUES TO BE PAID, giving edicts that have wreaked havoc for businesses and families in PA. It’s not just a mask.

This is the axe they want to use to execute you Freedom to live and thrive in the world. Don't fear them. Resist them."
Neutral,conservative,@Danette770,"No one could EVER convince me that Joe Biden received an historical record breaking number of Presidential votes (IN AMERICA'S HISTORY!! )  Biden has promised so many firsts >> ON DAY ONE >> face masks, ushering in Islam, teaching Islam in our schools, opening the borders to millions of illegals, taking away your guns and all gun rights, re-setting the Obama pact with Iran, sending our jobs off to China & elsewhere, defunding all police, shutting down border patrol & ICE and making all current illegals automatic American citizens, destroying your healthcare, obliterating your 401K, taxing citizens to death + much more. Basically assuring that America becomes the next 3rd world sh*thole and the rich like himself get richer on the backs of Americans."
Neutral,conservative,@Catsailor6969,"COVID? The purpose of any mass weapon is for the casualties it causes, to weaken it’s perpetrator’s opposition and give the perpetrators control.  History has many examples of those who desired world domination and conquest. They had their useful tools, who spread their covert wishes of oppression and power. All of them ultimately failed! Our President has shown that even the most at risk, initial casualties, can be treated and survive. ENOUGH of the use of your tools of oppression you leftist, socialist Democrats! We the People, WILL NOT comply and submit to you any longer! No longer will we be banished to our cells, no longer will we mask, no longer will we allow you to control us. Our contract to be governed DOES NOT give you that power! Civilly and disobediently, we will NOT go quietly into the darkness! Peacefully gather with family and friends, to be thankful for all that we have. What a humble and right thing THANKFULNESS IS! NO tyrants! We DO NOT submit! Make us."
Neutral,conservative,@carpedonktum,The media lost control of the COVID narrative when they whined about lack of PPE and overwhelmed hospitals while our social media feeds were filled with doctors and nurses dancing in empty hallways and wasting protective gear to trend on Tic Toc. They have been desperately trying to get the upper hand ever since. Never forget.

Because at 98 the waiting is too much. I offered to FaceTime her son. She cried more. She wanted a real hug. I in my PPE said enough. I too bent over into her arms she wrapped so tight around me. I broke the rule. I hugged her till she could breathe. We both had a healing. I’d do it again. Love matters most. The older folks in long term care haven’t been touched or hugged. It’s causing failure to thrive. Hugs are a necessary part of living. “ - shared from a nurse

Positive,conservative,@AlexandraSasha,"For nine months now people have been holding their tongues afraid to call out this Covid situation for what it truly is - a scam and a Trojan Horse for a Socialist Technocracy. Is it just a “conspiracy theory” if the United Nations and our political leaders are openly saying what their plans are?  They don’t want private businesses, they don’t want you to have any private property, they want to implement Universal Basic Income and other Socialist policies - and they want everyone vaccinated with the Bill Gates mRNA vaccine more than once.  How are people so passive about this? Sheep being lead to the slaughter house - and dragging all the smart people with them through their willful ignorance and cognitive dissonance."
Positive,conservative,@deplorabledosh,This is what your masks have done you stupid sheep. I told yall that the mask is the first step to the star of David. Our star of David will be an app or tattoo or paperwork saying we have been vaccinated or tested. The result will be the same...concentration camps and starving those who don't comply. KEEP WEARING THE MASKS YOU IDIOTS...THEY LITERALLY DO NOTHING TO STOP COVID.
