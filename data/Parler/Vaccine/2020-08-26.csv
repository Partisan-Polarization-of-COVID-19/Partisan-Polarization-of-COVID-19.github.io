They are denied all govt aid and many were not even eating daily. My goal is 50 families this month. The need is very desperate. They are still under lock down and it seems the govt is now trying to starve them out by denying them even food parcels.  Please if you can help...go to my website. Please HELP!

Yea 1% of the US population is 3million people which significantly impacts everything including the economy for reference, there are 328.2 million people in the US. The damage it does internally to the people who don’t die is something you might not have to go through but it’s your responsibility to make things better for your country. If we don’t get it under control, more than 3million will die. So far, there have been 154 thousand deaths in the US. That’s more people than was necessary. We have more deaths than anywhere else in the world and you won’t wear a mask for what? Bc it’s a little uncomfortable? My mom’s friend has one of the worst immune systems and cases of asthma you will ever see In your entire life and she still wears a mask.

Positive,conservative,@Gclefginger,"Part five of five But I wonder now if I should change my presentation and say, “There is no significant indication of reinfection. Only anecdotal reports of reinfection.” And, “What does it mean if, out of perhaps millions of positives, only a handful may, repeat, may have had a reoccurrence—or may not have been entirely rid of the disease after three months or so?”  I have not seen other recovered COVITES stand up and say, “Wait a minute. I have immunity. I don’t have to wear a mask during a five hour flight. I can hug everybody. EVERYBODY.” I don’t know where these people are? They don’t know who I am cause I sheeple through my days. I would like a COVITE leader. I am not a leader. Believe me. When I had leadership hoisted on me it didn’t go well. But I would gladly follow a sensible intelligent COVITE leader. And we can start a hugging movement because we can, with impunity or immunity. I don’t know which word is best."

Here Is An Update On Immunity.“ Bruce Y. LeeSenior Contributor.   Personally, I have been a bit sheeple. I wear a mask to shop. I don’t wear it outside, I don’t wear it around family and friends. I wear it as mandated at work. At work, I always have practiced universal precautions. I don’t wear gloves where not needed and I have avoided a shield or goggles and have not been “caught” as yet. I wear it because like the toy story dinosaur, I don’t like confrontation. I don’t want others to be stressed out. They don’t know me or my viral history. I guess my sheeple compliance is more out of empathy. I want to be a source of healing and I work with so many very sick people."

Positive,conservative,@JasonBeatty,"So today I was at a local large store, and I did not have my mask on. While checking out, this older gentleman walked up to me with a mask on and said ""Hey! I just want to thank you for not wearing a mask! It is a statement for all of us and I wish more people would stand up for it! I am tired of everyone being so scared of this crap!"" Then he walked out of the store. At first I was shocked because he was wearing one, and why would he not take his off, but then I got to thinking that he may think that the mask is useful for HIM but it is not right to make other's wear one. I don't know if that was his thinking or not, but it was a genuine ""thank you"". It was nice, brought a smile to my face, and gave me a TINY bit of hope. #hopeful #masksdontwork #antimask #wwg1wga #MAGA"

The Dr said they cant even write it on the papers or put it on record in the computer and WOULDNT write it on my papers that the mask was the cause, but DID tell me they are seeing it ALL the time now.  I KNEW THIS AND SAID SO TO EVERYONE. They wont even write me a note so that I dont have to wear one when out, though I cant breath with it on. I have NEVER in my life had this or Strep or anything. I havent had tonsils since I was a year old. I am so sick I cant even do the swish n swallow.  Had I had enough sense to record this I could of had it right there on audio!
