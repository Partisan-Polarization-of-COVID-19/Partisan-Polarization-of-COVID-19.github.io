Fast forward to the future, they were caught dining with their family and friends and without their masks. And even if they were caught, they still abide with their orders.  But there is one politician that needs to be on the Wall of Shame, and that is Denver Mayor Michael Footpenis....errrr....I mean....Hancock. Hancock urged Denver residents to stay home for Thanksgiving and have themselves a small turkey instead. But this clown was caught traveling to Mississippi to see his wife and daughter. After that happened, he issued an ""apology"" to the city of Denver of his actions. But remember, peasants! Do as I say, not as I do.
