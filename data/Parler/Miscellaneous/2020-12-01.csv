Negative,conservative,@COLconservative,"I drove from CO to OK to have Thanksgiving with family. On my way home I joked with a guy at the gas station that it felt like I was returning to prison; I was only half kidding. For months my sister had been telling me how normal things were in OK. I believed her but it was quite eye opening to experience it myself. These contrasting pics of CO vs OK gyms tell the story better than my words could: CO gym (only open because counties fought back after Polis moved them to red) -extremely limited capacity of 10 per room (hence the tarps - credit given for creatively exploiting a loophole) -masks required even while doing cardio solo on socially distanced equipment  -no locker room, drinking fountain use -must make an appointment OK gym (open fully, in addition to restaurants & other businesses) -no masks or capacity limits  -distancing encouraged but people don‚Äôt freak about it  -you can get a drink, hit the shower & actually breathe while exerting yourself -go when you feel like it"

Neutral,conservative,@JonathanWilberger,"Last night, I went into Wal-Mart to grab paper plates and a bottle of wine. I use a gator so I can wear it around my neck. It makes people less likely to try and start crap with me if they see that I at least have a mask in my possession. But I don't pull it up around my face. So as I was going through the entrance, the associate asks me ""do you have a mask?"" I said ""yep I got one right here"" and pointed to the gator around my neck. She said ""oh ok"" and I walked through without hassle. As I left she wished me a good night. We do not have to be rebellious in order to acquire fresh air at the store. People are so wired and brainwashed into thinking that masks are our salvation that they actually calm down if they see you have one in your possession. You don't have to pull it up to your face."

Total disregard of the bill of rights through shamdemic legislation. 3rd world-esque election fraud. Unpunished military insubordination of the Commander in Chief (Syria pull out). Allegedly CIA security team firing on Army Rangers who were in Berlin to seize voting servers. We're heading for a collision course in the coming weeks.
