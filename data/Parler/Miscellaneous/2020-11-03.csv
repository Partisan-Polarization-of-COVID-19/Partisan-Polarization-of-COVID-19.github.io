I never could have dreamed that a stay at home dad from Kansas, making videos in his spare time could be so blessed as I have. From being invited to the White House, to traveling around the country, and being elevated to a position where I could reach 273,000 people on Twitter, 231,000 people on Parler, 54,000 people on youtube, 51,000 people on Facebook, and 38,000 people on Instagram. Thank you and I love you all. I am the luckiest guy in history."

Neutral,conservative,@Iluvmotherhood,"I laugh at the ridiculousness of how smart the Coronavirus is. People are so gullible. Yes I think it is real & people can die. But everything else is Bull. Let me get it straight: I WILL get it if I go to church, or a bar, a Trump Rally, a funeral of a loved one, or school, or stay out past 10pm, but I WON’T get it at a riot (protest), a plane, an amusement park, a restaurant ONCE I sit down, a funeral of someone being honored by the left, or any huge box store like Walmart.  Got it. 🤦🏻‍♀️ Give me a break. It’s a virus people. We will all probably get it. It was modified in a lab because there is no virus that has its ability of being able to thrive anywhere and in any condition and also have no rhyme or reason in which gets it, how they get it, their symptoms,, now getting it again. I am over it all. So I post this because I am mad. My daughter is exhausted every day from wearing a mask in school. One of my drs says this is a huge mistake for healthy people to wear them.  #covid"

Neutral,conservative,@DiamondAndSilk,Diamond and Silk have a question. Did Pfizer take almost 2 Billion dollars of American tax dollars to make 100 Million doses of vaccines by the end of the year but now they can only deliver 25 Million doses and they plan to send half of those doses overseas? Did Americans get $h!tted by Pfizer?

Only problem was they found out he had COVID in the eight inning and pulled him from the game. Participating in the postgame celebration violated COVID rules. Wait, what? This player has been around his teammates in the preceding games and for almost the entire final game of the World Series. So somehow at the end of the game he was more infectious? What a bunch of crap. Let this man have his moment. The idiots questioning this have unlikely ever played sports at a high level and spend their lives as overpaid bureaucrats.
