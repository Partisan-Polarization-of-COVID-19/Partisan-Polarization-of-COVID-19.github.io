Substitute and student teachers are better than kids trying to figure it out on their own at home. Not to mention all the intangibles: Socialization, counseling services, meals at school, etc."
Neutral,conservative,@Angiez00r,So last Friday I was having Shortness of breath and other symptoms. I immediately quarantined myself from my family. Took a COVID-19 test Saturday and tomorrow the quarantine period is over and still no test results. I asked for a steroid inhaler and that wouldn't have been given to me if I hadn't asked. What a poor system. If they would allow Hydroxychloroquine we wouldn't be in the current situation of high cases. I believe the front line doctors. I go back to work Monday without test results since the labs are overwhelmed.

After months of lockdowns, business closings and mandatory face masks for all indoor gatherings, the governor has declared that face masks aren’t required to vote.

Positive,conservative,@DavidWDunn,"Fauci is now recommending goggles. Will the mask Nazis wear goggles? If not, then they are picking and choosing what they are willing to submit to, same as those who choose not to wear a mask.  I’ll go out on a limb and say they don’t wear goggles, but continue to berate those who don’t wear masks. Hypocrisy follows the liberal like a shadow."

I’m not afraid of Tyrants, and no American should be, because we outnumber them greatly, and the only thing they run on is Fear,  and you see in there Media they pump Fear into the Corona Virus.  When what they should be pumping is solutions.   They don’t do that, they never offer any solutions.  Instead it’s Wear a Mask 😷  Shut-up, and wait for a Vaccine 💉  That’s not Public Health And I won’t Subscribe to it! -Ian Smith"

I was at the beach with thousands and 99% did not have on a mask and really did not “social distance”. Then there were the few who looked like complete idiots wearing a mask at the beach outdoors in 90’ temps. You could just tell they were dumb ass Democrats!"

There should never be and there is no goal to stop college students from getting an infection they have no problem with.”"
