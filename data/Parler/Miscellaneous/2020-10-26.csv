Negative,conservative,@FreeEarthlings,"Dr. #ReinerFuellmich on #PCRtestScandal  The #Covid19Crisis must be renamed a #CoronaScandal; and those responsible for it must be criminally prosecuted and sued for civil damages. How dangerous is the virus? What is the significance of a positive #PCRtest? What is the collateral damage with respect to #health and #economy? An international network of lawyers will argue the biggest #TortCase ever - the #CoronaFraudScandal - which has unfolded into probably the greatest #CrimesAgainstHumanity ever committed. #Scientists and #lawyers recognise that as a result of the deliberate panic-mongering and the corona measures enabled by this panic, #democracy is in great danger of being replaced by #FascistTotalitarian models.

Once this pandemic is finished my thought is that both parties will return to their corrupt spending practices and require more tax dollars to do so. Hopefully Trump the outsider will win a second term and put us back on a strong fiscal course.

The fact is ppl get the flu thousands EVERY SINGLE YEAR and some die that’s life. Many Thousands more than ppl w Covid. Flu season has been happening over a century yet NO MANDATORY MASKS! Why? Masks suppress our immune system and make it impossible to become immune to this virus. That’s a proven fact! Most people have had the flu for over it and been in contact with someone who has it and don’t get sick again bc they are immune to that flu strand. Simple common sense.

However fans can watch a live stream of the game at the social club at the stadium with the windows blacked out so they can't see the pitch.  Perhaps the brains trust imposing these rules could explain why you are less likely to catch the virus inside than out in the fresh air. #ukparler #covidnonsense #scamdemic

No! According to the Biden camp we Trump supporters are doomed!

The fact is ppl get the flu thousands EVERY SINGLE YEAR and some die that’s life. Many Thousands more than ppl w Covid. Flu season has been happening over a century yet NO MANDATORY MASKS! Why? Masks suppress our immune system and make it impossible to become immune to this virus. That’s a proven fact!

Once this pandemic is finished my thought is that both parties will return to their corrupt spending practices and require more tax dollars to do so. Hopefully Trump the outsider will win a second term and put us back on a strong fiscal course.

The passage of the First Step Act, the 2018 bipartisan bill that provided one of the largest overhauls of the criminal justice system in decades, is chief among those that they say blunt critiques of the president’s racism. They also point to the $250 million annual increase in funding for historically Black colleges and universities under the FUTURE Act he signed into law in 2019 and Black unemployment numbers that were at their lowest in nearly a decade in the months before the economic downturn caused by the pandemic.

Neutral,conservative,@Jmanuola,"Within striking distance? I can't even imagine how any of these polls can account for a Trump +20 enthusiasm gap. 56% feel they're still better off after 4 years of Trump even with COVID and the financial crisis of COVID. That's 9 pts. better than any previous president running for re-election. They cannot beat us, even with cheating, if we turn out like we turn out for his rallies, and car rallies and boat rallies and biker rallies. They cannot win, if we show up. This is one of those rare times when we cannot lose if we just show up. Run it up, Herman. Leave no doubt. - Remember the Titans."
Neutral,conservative,@Isleofkent2141,"Fact check: Since 1/2020 204,000 Americans have died, 87,000 died of COVID-19 w/o pre-existing conditions, 117,000 have died due to pre-existing conditions who might have had COVID-19. But what you don’t know is 118,000 unborn babies have been murdered in USA during this time frame. Another fact no one seems to care about is on a yearly average 2000 Women die due to botched abortion at PPH, and another 800 +are rendered unable to become pregnant again due to botched abortions!"

Neutral,conservative,@ardevinewriter,Ireland on the verge of possible second lockdown. It is impossible to halt the spread of Covid without a vaccine which might never come. Full lockdowns merely kick the can down the road. Destroying the economy & people's lives for a virus that even in severe cases now unlikely to lead to death is a monumental act of self harm.
Neutral,conservative,@Jmanuola,Biden/Harris (along with the rest of the left) accuse Trump of being responsible for the death of 220K Americans due to COVID. It finally occurred to me why that is asinine.  Do these same people blame FDR for the 400K+ Americans who were killed in WW2?  Did FDR have any less or more control over his response to Hitler & Hirohito than Trump had over this virus? No one goes around blaming FDR for 400K+ deaths.

Neutral,conservative,@EmbraceTheTruth,"EMBRACE THE TRUTH! Trump is our friend. Are you still wearing your MUZZLE? Are you still partially paralyzed and cowering under the exaggerated threat of Covid-19 propaganda being perpetrated by tyrants and their subservient leftist media? Popularized, “dark forces” are taking advantage of “the people’s” timidity and vulnerability to trust in their lies. This, that they may ultimately, finally control everyone and everything ... Throw off the chains of tyranny. Discard the muzzle. Take back your liberty. Return to the free movement and lifestyle you knew this time last year. We are greater in number and hold greater power than those who would enslave us. They hold no power except that we surrender. If “they” (the leftists) succeed in the upcoming elections, our freedoms, our way of “Life, Liberty, Property, and Pursuit of Happiness” will fall under “their” command."
