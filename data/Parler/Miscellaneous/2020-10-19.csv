Under that age range, you are talking about death rates that either mirror the flu or are less than the flu as you get into children. While a flu vaccine is typically only 40% effective, new vaccines for COVID have shown effectiveness rates of 95%. That means that once the vaccine is deployed, COVID will be far less of a problem than the regular flu. Yet, Fauci still wants you to wear ineffective masks and socially distance for years afterward.

Does the address match the current address of the register voter? Is the voter a U.S. Citizen over 18 and registered in that state? Has the voter cast a ballot in another state?  Any ballots received after November 3rd shall be disallowed.  He issues an Exec Order requiring this Federal oversight. He has the right to do it. We are in the middle of a ""Pandemic"". He can claim obvious fraud. The courts can't stop him. He can just ignore the attempts of Leftist judges. He is the President!"
