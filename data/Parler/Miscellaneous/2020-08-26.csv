For example hazard = COVID-19 infection and probability of infection in a shop= 0.5 ( a high estimate) then the risk is high.

Imagine dying knowing a bottle of Tonic water could have saved your life. Imagine dying isolated from the family that you had treated with Tonic water. The eternally genocidal Communists and their Media lackeys censor these effective treatments. We ran out of toilet paper and face masks but not Tonic water. I don't think I watched an episode of Dr Quinn Medicine Woman where either tonic water or Quinine wasn't mentioned.

And, if the president doesn't trust the intelligence community, law enforcement, the press, the military, the Supreme Court, the medical professionals, election officials and the postal workers, then why should we?

Thanks, China for no warning, Thanks Who, and CDC for over-inflated casualty models, thanks panic-media. You have literally scared people to death.

Cain had been battling Stage 4 colon cancer and it‚Äôs very possible that was the underlying reason for his demise.

Stage 4 colon cancer is late-stage cancer. Life expectancy is lower than it is for earlier stages of cancer.

We send the majority of funds directly to South Africa to a group called the VVS whom we work very closely with to ensure food and necessities reach the white minority.  The government has refused food parcels for white South Africans and denied all Covid aid to whites.  There are many things we could use help with because this issue is very important in fighting back the onslaught of fake propaganda against whites and conservatives all over the world. If we ignore South Africa, we give the green light for this to continue to spread to us. #AmericanPatriots #Conservatives #MAGA please check out the site and hit the donate button so that we may continue this fight.

Neutral,conservative,@Gclefginger,"Part one of five So it has been 125 days since I tested Positive for COVID-19 (C-19). I worked with a patient five days earlier and got it from that person. I was achy, fever of 99.6, sneezing and coughing and, in the end, 10 days of no smell. I went sailing through it like it was an inconvenient cold. Since then I have been tested five times as have other health care workers; not because they were positive, but as part of their job requirements. I have been negative four times and this last test was yesterday. I expect it to be negative.   I am not Typhoid Mary. I can‚Äôt infect anyone now. I strongly believe this specific virus will not reoccur with me. To fortify my belief, I have been searching in journals and postings for any studies investigating reoccurrence in those who already tested positive and/or had the symptoms (after which they tested negative at least once)."
Neutral,conservative,@JosephLemieux,"Here‚Äôs my thought on the Democratic scheme of mail in voting. The Democratic Party has been setting the stage for a total chaotic election. Their doing this by submitting lawsuits for allowing mail in voting because of Covid-19, allowing ballot harvesting, ease on signature verifications, allowing felons and prisoners to vote and working with Democratic governors to eliminate voter ID. What this will do is create so much chaos that we will not know who wins on election night. It will take weeks if not months to sort through the mess they have created; it might even have to go all the way to the SCOTUS. Now, during all this chaos the speaker of the house will assume the role of the president. That‚Äôs right Nancy Pelosi will assume the Presidential role, which could be as early as mid November. Maybe that why Biden has 600 lawyers ready for election night! What's your thoughts!"

I`m a conservative voter last election and one of those that hovered for five mins before putting a x against conservative. Why is the contract the government awarded to Serco of 2 billion of our money been given for migrants to be put up in 4 star hotels, while there are homeless on our streets, ex service personnel homeless, people going foodbanks, self employed because of Covid, loosing everything and some of them not being able to afford rent etc. You were elected on a mandate of controlling our borders, not putting migrants up in luxury and paying them spending money. Why are you not sending them back to France? International law says the person must seek asylum in the first safe country. The Northwest Hotels are booked up until next year, including a hotel near where I live. We need to look after our own homeless Boris, our own people going hungry!"

Our city council threatened to steal our money through fines if we did not comply. The government continues to threaten to kidnap people and throw them in jail to infect them with covid-19 if they do not comply with their authoritarian orders! This is ridiculous!

Neutral,liberal,@AJGarrett,"Donald Trump was golfing while his ""best friend"" died in the hospital. When will the MAGA cult realize that Donny John's a sociopath who only cares about his reelection?  He claims of the daily deaths from COVID-19: ""It is what it is."" He's actively dismantling the USPS to interfere in an election; this is a constitutional crime that makes Watergate look like minor vandalism. And he's called for fewer tests to keep publicly available numbers down to boost his election prospects. Trump is a conman who will squeeze every last penny out of America for his family, himself, and his supporters. Louis Dejoy, Postmaster General, owns over $70 million in stocks of USPS' direct competition. That is the definition of a conflict of interest. All that said: yes the #wrongtrump did die last night. If God had to take one Trump, then it should have been the wannabe dictator who uses others' lives to enrich himself and keep himself in power. Fuck Trump. #trump2020 #trumptrain #trump2020landslide"
Neutral,conservative,@Fdlovell,"Ok, Nancy! Once again, I am forced to rely on my long-held belief, whatever the Dems accuse someone of doing is a reflection of their intent, & it happened again. Now Pelosi is alleging that the President will send Federal officers to the polling places to intimidate people. So let's not be surprised if we see BLM & others outside of the polling places. I find the House hearing with the Postmaster General interesting, he stated clearly they don't need the money & guaranteed the proper delivery of all mail-in ballots, yet that wasn't enough, the Dems pushed ahead with vicious allegations of a coverup fraud. Did you see how they could convene a House hearing on this but don't have the time to pass a COVID stimulus bill? In fact, when approached by Reps on this she refused to even talk with them. By the way, I don't know about you but while watching the RNC last night I couldn't keep a dry eye, so much for that macho guy image, VOTE Frank D. Lovell Citrus County FL Pres Trump Club"
