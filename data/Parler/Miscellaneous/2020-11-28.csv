Positive,conservative,@JonathanWilberger,"The quickest and easiest way to tell if you are being lied to about covid is to watch the leaders who scream the loudest about how people need to wear masks and stay home. If they start getting caught breaking their own bogus orders, then you know without a doubt that they have been lying to you the entire time because deep down, these leaders know that there is no danger. Otherwise they wouldn't be running around having parties without masks on. We need to use our brains and look at the overwhelming evidence. Politicians are horrible liars. The pandemic was faked. There is no danger. Covid is the flu. Time to go back to normal. Time for people to stop the silliness."
Positive,conservative,@GrahamLedger1,Wear a mask? Social distance? Stay at home? Don‚Äôt go to work? California is a prime example of radical politicians seizing an opportunity where people are basked in fear in order for these politicians to consume more liberty and more power over the people.
Neutral,conservative,@COLconservative,"So the day after Denver Mayor Michael Hancock gets busted/ publicly humiliated being a complete and utter hypocrite mi-travel, Colorado Governor Jared Polis announces he has been near someone who tested positive for COVID-19 so even though his own test was negative he will do the right thing and quarantine... Call me a conspiracy theorist, but it seems like awfully convenient timing. Personally I believe it‚Äôs nothing more than a smokescreen to take attention away from Hancock and quiet some of the ‚Äúnow why should we listen to ANY of rules?!‚Äù crowd. Then again I have a very low opinion of politicians and almost no trust in any of them"
Neutral,conservative,@fixamerica,"Fix American Discussion #4 *Don't forget to Echo, Follow & Subscribe Understand the Coronavirus 1. Created by China replace the USA as a new Economic superpower 2. The death rate decreases compared to the last 10 years because of strict lockdown 3. More than 50% of deaths by Covid are those people who died because of some other reasons. Imagine what happened to the world? A virus with less than 1% death rate and 50% of that 1% are also fake.  4. People cannot find millions of sick patients in hospitals around them and a massive increase of new graves in Cemeteries. 5. Vaccine for a virus with a death rate of less than 1% is ridiculous. We need to think about their big plan connected with this vaccine. 6. Democrats used this virus as a tool to win this election with the help of fake ballots. 7. Money that was supposed to be distributed among millions is now part of a few rich people bank accounts. 8. Don't trust stats presented by CDC, Big Tech, and mainstream social media."

Neutral,conservative,@JonathanWilberger,I hope everyone had an awesome Thanksgiving. My family and I didn't lock down. We all hung out together and made fun of maskerbators and hypocondriacs as we ate good and hardy. :)
Neutral,conservative,@Gary4trump,Say hell no governor Newsom! Hell no governor Newsom! I said hell no governor Newsom! I refuse the lock down now or ever again! From now on we‚Äôre going to have BLM riots and dinner soir√©es like you had every day at our place! Say hell no governor Newsom! We‚Äôre done taking any orders from you.
