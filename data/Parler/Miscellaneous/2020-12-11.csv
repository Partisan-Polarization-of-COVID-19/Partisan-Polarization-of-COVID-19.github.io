Addressing scientific misconduct downstream to medical research, particularly when biased interpretations of clinical studies lead to an over-optimistic assessment of a new drug, which ends up being withdrawn from the market after harming many individuals.

Positive,conservative,@DaveRPh,"Time to ditch the masks.   Why are people still wearing masks? Their is no scientific reason to do so.  The reasons are: 1. People want to be part of the 'group' and look 'clinical'.  2. Crafters are all in with the newest 'mask making' projects. 3. People know they don't work but are afraid to stand up for their Constitutional rights. 4. There is massive intimidation coming from the Democrats, who are using masks as the first step in obedience training.  5. People are making $ millions from masks and they control the false narrative that masks work. If masks really stop the spread of COVID you would hear TV commercials making this claim...they don't."

They killed 6% of the hundreds of thousands they claimed have died from the China Virus.  It’s all making sense now. China couldn’t strike deals or put spies in our government under Trump so they released a biological weapon. A biological weapon that the WHO AND CDC HAVE TWO PATENTS ON.  It’s simple. Remove the drug that can treat the China Flu. Then spend 300 billion of tax payer dollars to make a vaccine. Cheat to put Biden in office giving the Communists access and power in our government and then no more “pandemic”. WAKE UP!! This is all smoke and mirrors to turn our country on its head and to make the deep state corruption more corrupt and powerful.  Trump didn’t kill anyone!! Corrupt people in govts foreign and domestic did. Anthony Fauci and Bill Gates should hand for this. It was their greatest achievement."
