Positive,conservative,@HopeSprings,"Governor Kristi Noem (R-SD) has been the only Governor in America that has gotten it right. Not only has she left wearing a mask up to the individual, she never shut her state down, or even the buinesses in her state. She even stands at the South Dakota State Captiol, everyday, no matter the weather, and prays over her state, and then walks the halls of the South Dakota state capitol and prays over every legislator's office, and elected official, that God will guide them and help them make the right desicions. South Dakota is in the best shape and condition than any other state in our nation. Governor Noem is a true constitutionalist! She is an example and an inspiration to us all! Copied. Cause it should be said, known and shared all across this country that Gov. Noem is exactly the kind of leader every politician should strive to be!!"

If they say something and make me leave even after explaining to them the 'exemptions' in place, they get a 1 star google, yelp review and don't get any business (money) from me ever again.

Real Americans are unapologetic, unafraid to express our views, we don't hide. I saw a segment a few days ago about how many conservatives are afraid to share their views, afraid to put up a Trump sign, afraid of retaliation and stigmatization.  Really folks? You are Americans, start acting like it. The cancel culture can go pound sand. They don't have any power if you don't give it to them. What good is your First Amendment right if you refuse to exercise it, defend it? We have our own businesses, I am on the ballot. But my family will not be silenced, my kids are taught that if you don't believe it 100%, you don't really believe it. You don't have to be mean, or a jerk about your views, but you should never back down from your values. Afraid to stand up for your beliefs? Remember those that bled so you could freely believe them.

Negative,conservative,@JaySheepdog,"CDC manipulating C19 data to inflate numbers. Data reported by #LamestreamMedia is grossly high, in the order of nearly 3x the actual deaths. This screenshot from the CDC shows deaths at 38k (plus 6500 probable) in fine print under the 105k death count. (2 June 2020, CDC Covid Data Tracker) Now only showing inflated number of deaths which includes deaths not caused by C19 but victims testing positive. Death could be an automobile accident or anything else completely unrelated. #ScamDemic #PlanDemic #TheMoreYouKnow #DarkToLight #TheMoreYouKnow #WWG1WGA #AllAboutTheElection #TrashTheMask"

It also failed to replenish the low stockpile of personal protective equipment (PPE) that hospitals and community health centers rely on to effectively combat COVID-19.

Neutral,conservative,@Jayanne82,A little concerned regarding an article I read in a little Island weekly rag. The topic was about residents observing the Guidelines set out for COVID-19. In the article it stated Democrats were observing the Guidelines; fewer Republicans. What I am curious about is when/where/what did this so-called information appear. Was there a survey? I live here and wasn't aware of any such survey. I wonder how a statement like that can be made without fact based knowledge.
Neutral,conservative,@carpedonktum,"The news keeps chanting 150,000 deaths from COVID-19. That's over the course of 5 months. That's 30,000 a month, 1000 a day, 41 an hour. That's totally scary without context... so here it is. Corona Virus accounts for 5% of the expected deaths this year. 241,000 Americans die each month, that's 7945 a day, 331 an hour. I wonder why the information isn't presented like this? I think you know."

Neutral,conservative,@Herzshannen,"h/t Edward Koan  So William Barr, our esteemed attorney General, goes before the House Judiciary Committee yesterday and the democrats treat him like a piece of crap, ask fake and awful questions, and then when he goes to speak they interrupt him and say they are claiming back their time. They would not even let him take a 5 minute bathroom break - if a criminal suspect was denied the chance to take a leak they would claim police brutality. This is how hearings and trials are conducted in Iran and China not the United States. These democrats effectively censored him just like the leftists in social media censor covid opinions of great doctors which do not promote their agenda. They have no regard for our constitution, for fairness, nor for civility and decency. They are truly brown shirts and black shirts. If they are so right what are they afraid of? Are we gonna fight back or just take their BS?"
