Neutral,conservative,@ArthurFitzgerald22,"Here‚Äôs the answers to those questions Katie. 1.) Black on Black killings do not happen because of race. A black person, has never killed another black person, for the simple fact that they are black. The white policeman that murdered George Floyd had his home searched, and had applied to join the KKK. This shows that the White man murdering the black man was solely a racially inspired murder. 2.) People want the police who brutalise innocent black people to be charged and prosecuted. Petitions online help, but protests actually show the anger, and help communities understand that racism is not okay, and we can not be silent on the matter. 3.) Many protests were socially distant and the protesters wore masks. Strange how you hate masks and lockdown, but when it‚Äôs the BAME community fighting for their human rights you question it? When people are angry because someone has been murdered for their skin colour, why is your initial reaction to argue with them, not stand with them?"

Surprise-If you are in danger, make the decision whether it‚Äôs time to act and then do it, fast. Usually the person that lands the first solid impact will win. People aren‚Äôt used to getting hit hard, it‚Äôs very disorienting. 3.

Neutral,conservative,@BeachloverKW,I believe there‚Äôs a silent virus going on in this country with no vaccinations that will help. It‚Äôs our colleges and universities that are producing these liberal minded young adults.  Teach your children at an early age what is right from wrong! We did and we‚Äôre proud they‚Äôre young young republicans!
Neutral,conservative,@Deevaughn,Good morning patriots! üá∫üá∏ Happy Monday! Off to work I go where I will be in close contact with over 60 people today! Three months into the deadliest virus know to man and I‚Äôm still alive! Health comes from the inside! #chiropractic #getadjusted #healthyliving #immunesystem #nomask
Neutral,conservative,@Goumba66,"So let me get this straight...we lockdown in CA to contain the virus & slow down the infection rate. Then, we have to let people protest and we shouldn‚Äôt worry about a spike in infections. Now we have a spike in infections, and we have to lockdown again. But it wasn‚Äôt the protesters being out that caused the spike, it was people who go to church and go out to dinner. üòê"
