Extreme actions warrant extreme measures.  I don't give a damn if they arrange it so that one person enters the voting room at a time with a gas mask on - just as long as it's in person with an ID! If people can go out and burn cities down while shoulder to shoulder with one another, or go buy flowers for their garden - or any number of unnecessary things that people have been doing despite the ""risk"" of COVID19 (which is only a concern if you're in a small percentile), they can be a damn American and vote the way that it is supposed to be done. The COVID19 fear-mongering and consequent mail-in ballot ""solution"" was an ingenious, brain-washing scam devised to sway the election. It worked. Pass this on and get the message out if you agree.
