There's a constitutional process this course of events must follow. On top of that, Sidney Powell and Lin Woods (two of America's most powerful and peer-respected attorneys) are still pursuing their course of action with the full blessing of the White House and White House attorneys.

Fines of $1000 per person/ offence and up to $100,000.00 through the courts. Our freedom has been taken away and replaced with what I can only describe as despotism.  Fight for your president, fight for your freedom. American people are living in the last bastion of true freedom and it is jeopardy of falling to Marxism just like Canada has.
