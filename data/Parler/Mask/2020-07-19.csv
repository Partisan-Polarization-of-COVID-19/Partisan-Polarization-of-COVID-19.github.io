They have yet to tell their citizens that zinc when used with quercetin (opens the cells up like hydroxychloroquine) is a great cheap preventative and will lesson symptoms of COVID-19 and using Budesonide and other anti inflammatories when diagnosed will ensure rapid recovery most of the time. Instead they mandate mask use, lock downs, expensive high end drugs, ventilators while putting COVID patients into nursing homes, and promoting useless vaccines (which we‚Äôve already paid for). They act this stupid and reckless and the MSM blames it on Trump.  What do you think they will do to you if he loses?  Trump 2020 4 More Years of Leftist butthurt!"

Surgical masks can only prevent particles bigger than 100mm from entering- totally ineffective at blocking Covid.

Neutral,conservative,@ErickFaust,"Sunday's Savannah, ClusterChuck Todd, hit the ground running, literally fulminating at the mouth to call for contact tracing and a national mandate for all to wear masks. His vilification of the president for the rise of the plandemic went unbridled. When interviewing HHS Secretary Alex Azar; Mr. Azar spoke pragmatically about the ""crowds exercising their 1st Amendment rights while not wearing masks"" [sic], ClusterChuck immediately cut him off and segued into a wide-eyed interview with Commie Cuomo, who predictably echoed the left's narrative of totalitarianism. To further his joy of pocket pool, he's now ushering on John Bolton. The disease of liberalism is far more deadly than CV-19, and is 100% fatal."
