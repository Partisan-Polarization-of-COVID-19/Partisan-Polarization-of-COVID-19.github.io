I just want to thank you for not wearing a mask! It is a statement for all of us and I wish more people would stand up for it! I am tired of everyone being so scared of this crap!"" Then he walked out of the store. At first I was shocked because he was wearing one, and why would he not take his off, but then I got to thinking that he may think that the mask is useful for HIM but it is not right to make other's wear one. I don't know if that was his thinking or not, but it was a genuine ""thank you"".
