Neutral,conservative,@CruiseLover,"So is it working? Is the hipe about the surge of covid and the lockdowns distracting everyone from what is really going on? Because that is exactly what it is meant to do. We need to pay attention to the coruptness going on in our election. Don't let them distract you and cause confusion. Stay focused, Patriots!"
Neutral,conservative,@hucortezz,Installed as President? Hell no. #WeThePeople elected Donald J Trump.🇺🇸🗽 Do Not Concede.  Fuck your #WuhanVirus Shamdemic. Quit with your Orwellian planned unnecessary communistic lockdowns. Act like Americans and let Freedom Ring!
Neutral,conservative,@JHrusky,"One of the world's top pathologists: ""The coronavirus crisis is 'the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on an unsuspecting public'"" Lockdowns are ridiculous. Social distancing is useless. Masks are utterly useless. Paper and fabric masks are simply virtue signaling. PCR tests are unreliable."

They wage a cowardly war on liberty, private property, and small business from the comfort of their homes. Like fattened cattle calling on the farmer to butcher their neighbor."

Neutral,conservative,@Jamessenay383,What is really coming through the t.v./ wifi libtards are being mind controlled. facts mean nothing to these idiots. The globalists hypnotized the dumbasses of the world somehow on the first lockdowns. 9 mos later every libby soy boy says the exact same narrative programmed response all over the world
Neutral,conservative,@F0RtheRepublic,ALERT! PLEASE SPREAD THIS MANS MESSAGE. THE REAL PURPOSE FOR THE LOCKDOWNS.  I also have below the CDC survival rates of this scamdemic! 99.99% survival rate for nearly everyone! And they SHUT THE WHOLE WORLD Down for that???  Driving down the highway in the rain is more dangerous!! 🤦🏾‍♂️ God have mercy on us all 🙏
Neutral,conservative,@DSPetolicchio,"The people that hide at home, get social security, or some other form of government money, and lose nothing from lockdowns, are the kind of people who will, from the comfort of their homes, also argue for your arrest and your property seized and redistributed.  It's the same mentality, of severe selfishness, lack of self reflection, and a complete opposition to liberty. These would've been the Tories of our founding era."

Neutral,conservative,@dwight820,"How does the Left assert control and demand lockdowns? By manufacturing false infection numbers. Nearly 7,000 residents in North Carolina were told via text message last week that they tested positive for the Coronavirus despite not actually having contracted the disease. A man who fell off a ladder and died due to the injury was deemed to have died from Covid. Complete falsehood."
Neutral,conservative,@Jaysonveley,"I’m telling you right now, there’s going to be a growing movement against the covid lockdowns, restrictions and regulations. People are not going to put up with politicians telling them where they can go, how many people they can have in their homes, whether or not they wear masks in their homes, whether or not they can go to churches or synagogues, whether or not they can keep their business open, etc. We are Americans. Fighting for freedom is in our DNA."
