Positive,conservative,@DiannaLara,"Before COVID, if I had complained to a mental health professional that I was upset with my family or friends because they refused to wear a mask around me during flu season, I probably would have been told that I was being co-dependent and should take responsibility for my own fear, do what I feel is appropriate for me to stay healthy (like stay home), and not expect others to change their behavior just so I can feel safe. But not in 2020. We’re raising up a generation of malignant co-dependents who not only want to make others responsible to make them feel safe, but advocate for punishing anyone who won’t fall in line."

Positive,conservative,@Annaq2020,"Honestly I became a lot more anti-vax lately, just because we are told to vaccinate ourselves against a totally overblown and slightly more dangerous cold/flu virus. It seems as if the coronavirus is more so a Chinese bioweapon designed to intimidate the West into imposing costly lockdowns. China planned for us to get scared of this virus, overreact, and commit economic suicide. Once our economy is ruined, then China can just take over and rule the world. Thankfully, we have Trump as President. He is patriotic enough to understand that national lockdowns would be disastrous. Thank God we have Trump leading us through this totally overblown pandemic so well. #scamdemic #chinavirus"
