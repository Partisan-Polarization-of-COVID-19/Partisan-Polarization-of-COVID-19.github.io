Negative,conservative,@BrodenNielson1776,"About 7-8 months ago we had lockdowns nearly everywhere to stop the spread of the virus. Those same lockdowns put more people on welfare, made more people do drugs, made more people depressed and caused 60% of small businesses to close. Those lockdowns went on for weeks and the virus is still around. What makes democrats think it’s going to work this time?! #2020election  #endlockdowns  #tyranny  #trump2020"

Positive,conservative,@ConnorMulvey,"Just a reminder that the people who have fled socialism, communism and government oppression, did NOT vote for Joe Biden, despite the supposed xenophobe in the White House. All you people who have bathed in the fruits of capitalism under this administration but voted for your geriatric marxist savior, better get ready for a big change. Your white, bougie lifestyle is coming under attack. Your favorite little brunch spots will close (bring on higher taxes & a national lockdown), oil prices will skyrocket (no more offshore drilling), and purchasing power is going to take a hit. Bye bye “girls trips” on impulse. If most of you weren’t so poorly informed and governed by facts instead of emotion, you’d probably put two and two together and wish for the return of the Orange Man. However, your submission to your alleged victimhood will never allow you to get past yourself and you’ll always stay in the dark, yearning for more taxes and a larger nanny state. #parler #lowinformationvoters #usa"
