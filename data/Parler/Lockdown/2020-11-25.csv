It's also really been on my heart to help our wonderful President in some way, so I decided to kill 2 birds with one stone. A few days ago I got creative and did some graphic design work from home, then threw together a website and created some merchandise with my (first) design. I'm on a mission to make some income from home, while at the same time supporting Trump by raising money towards his fight to keep his rightful position as our President! So from now through 12/10/2020, I will be donating 10% from all purchases from my store to Trump's cause. So if you could PLEASE echo the hell out of this, that would be so amazing!

If they cared about voter fraud, they could print off a list of everyone who committed it And if they cared about lowering crime they would have already made the world a safer and better place.
