I recently became unemployed due to COVID (because I'm high risk) and it has really set us back quite a bit, so I had to do something. It's also really been on my heart to help our wonderful President in some way, so I decided to kill 2 birds with one stone. A few days ago I got creative and did some graphic design work from home, then threw together a website and created some merchandise with my (first) design. I'm on a mission to make some income from home, while at the same time supporting Trump by raising money towards his fight to keep his rightful position as our President! So from now through 12/10/2020, I will be donating 10% from all purchases from my store to Trump's cause. So if you could PLEASE echo the hell out of this, that would be so amazing! Thank you in advance for helping me, and for helping me to help our President!🇺🇲🤟❤️"

They also have AI listening and transcribing everything that is picked up by the microphone whether you are using the phone or not. Big Tech knows more about you than your parents or your spouse. If COVID was actually a highly dangerous pandemic, they would know instantly who to quarantine. If they were serious about ending political violence, they could arrest EVERYONE planning ANYTHING in a weekend. If they cared about voter fraud, they could print off a list of everyone who committed it And if they cared about lowering crime they would have already made the world a safer and better place.
