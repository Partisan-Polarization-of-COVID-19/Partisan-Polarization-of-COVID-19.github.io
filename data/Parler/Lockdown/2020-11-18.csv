Negative,conservative,@Americas1776,The Hypocrisy! California Governor Gavin Newsom has been demanding people stay indoors and cancel holidays but meanwhile he was recently seen celebrating a birthday over dinner at a restaurant.  Truly disturbing to see these governors going against restrictions they put into place. This is all about control over the public.  #covid19hoax #liberalhypocrisy #covid #governor #liberalsmustgo #lockdown #maga #california #trump2020 #endthelockdown #covidrestrictions
Negative,conservative,@Chiaramonte,Who can explain this one?  With the second wave of lockdowns starting to roll in. I know for my state Big Gretch is trying to push us around again. Many people I know are not going to stand for it.  We know the virus is real.  We know we all have a risk.  But don’t tell us we can’t see our family for the holidays. That’s our call as a family to decide if the risk of being sick is worth it or not.  Not the Governments job. It’s ours.  #michiganlockdown  #covid19  #endthelockdown  ECHO IF YOU AGREE!

Positive,conservative,@buskirk,"The Biden-Harris Team is already talking about 4-6 weeks of new national lockdowns if they take office.  Remember when it was 2 weeks to slow the spread?  Remember when if you just wore a mask, we wouldn't have to lockdown? (We've had mask mandates for months) Remember when we just needed better treatments and a vaccine? (Regeneron is widely available & multiples vaccines will be available before inauguration day. China has a widely distributed vaccine already) But still...they want to lock you in your house, stop your life, keep you away from church and your loved ones.  No."

Most real scientists say between 30 to 34 cycles is sufficient to return an accurate result of a person with active virus requiring attention/quarantine.
